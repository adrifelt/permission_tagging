When you start the app, the radar images are from the site closest to your location.\n\nNWS Alerts included with the free mode starting in v4.0. Only alerts issued to the your current county are sent and the alerts can be filtered so only the ones that interest you are used.\n\nDon\'t like our banners? Anyone can opt-out of banner in the settings for free.\n\nRadarNow! is a free download with access to Premium features. Use the FREE Standard version to monitor your local radar and receive NWS Alerts or choose to upgrade through the app to Premium if you want to activate the enhanced features. You may try the premium features with our free 5 day trial or purchase one year of access for $2.99 or $4.99 for two years. You will not automatically be billed and must manually renew when your access expires.\n\nThe 5 day free trial gives you free access to the premium features. Once the 5 day trial has passed, the app reverts back to the free \"standard\" mode. You will not be charged to use the free trial under any circumstances.\n\nLose or upgrade your phone or tablet? No problems. Your paid access moves with you. Buy once and have RadarNow! premium on all your devices too.\n\nRadarNow! Standard will automatically switch to RadarNow! Premium for free if your local radar site is off line so you can select another radar site.\n\nPlease use the \"Contact us\" form inside RadarNow! (menu-setting-contact us) if you encounter a problem or have a suggestion for improvement.\n\nWe value your input! It was suggestions and constructive critiques from users just like you that led to the new, improved RadarNow!.\n\nRadarNow! is designed to be fast, efficient and have great free options. If you want a full featured weather app that shows things like ski conditions or tide reports, we suggest using WeatherBug or Weather Channel. RadarNow! Standard (Free) provides animated radar, local conditions and NWS Alerts centered on your current location. Radar Now! Premium provides the same but allows you to select other radar sites as well as provide more zoom levels, range rings, selectable locations and a pannable map of the continental US with a looping weather radar.\n\nRadarNow! uses US radars only, therefore is active for entire U.S., Puerto Rico, Guam and areas of Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean that border the U.S.\n\nBattery is used ONLY when RadarNow! is active, otherwise RadarNow! has no effect on battery life. RadarNow! uses GPS and network location services to fix your location. If location services aren\'t available, Zip Code can be used with RadarNow! to set location.\n\nThis new version of RadarNow! was created by USNaviguide in cooperation with Mighty Pocket."

    description: "NOAA Weather is an unofficial NOAA android app.  It provides NOAA forecasts, animated radar, and current conditions, all in an intuitive and easy to use interface.  Just the information you need, provided accurately, quickly, and for your exact location.\n\n\342\230\205 \"A no-nonsense approach to show weather data on your phone, but done well and great looking\" - Android Central\n\nNOAA Weather uses NOAA point forecasts from your GPS location to get the most localized weather available.  Point forecasts are great for climbing, hiking, skiing, or any outdoor activity where weather from a nearby city isn\'t accurate enough.  \n\nGPS on the phone will provide the most accurate location, but usually isn\'t needed.  Nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi networks can also provide this information, and will be checked first to save time and battery.  You can also enter a location manually.\n\nTo provided highly localized forecasting, NOAA Weather uses point forecasts from the National Weather Service (NOAA/NWS), and is therefore only available in the US.\n\nPlease contact me at paulnadler@gmail.com if you have any questions or problems.\n\nThis is the ad supported free version of NOAA Weather.

You may notice a little more detail with the moon. \n\nHOW TO USE:\n\nJust install it - HD Widgets will do the rest.\n\nOnce installed it will show up in the *Installed* list in HD Widgets.\nThere\'s nothing else to open or see (so clicking on it won\'t do anything).\n\n\nWHY DID WE MAKE THIS PACK?\n\nWe released this as a separate 16MB image pack is because if we put these together with the main app (16MB), the total would be over 32MB! Most devices will never use these extra-large icons, so why load them up?\n\n\nRequirements:\nHD Widgets 3.0 & later\n1024x600 or more resolution tablet"

    description: "Don\'t be surprised by the weather again!\n\nThis app runs in the background and monitors the official National Weather Service (NWS) alerts for your area.  New alerts will appear on the status bar, and by selecting it, you can read the details.\n\nYou can also choose how urgent of a notification to get, based on the NWS Severity.  An Extreme alert coming through?  Then you\'d probably like vibrate, lights AND bell for that!  But a simple Wind Warning?  Probably not as much.  You can choose the level of response in the preferences.\n\nSimple Weather Alert allows you to monitor one location for NWS alerts.  If you want to monitor more locations (including locations that move with you), then consider purchasing Pro Weather Alert.\n\nSimple Weather Alert Features:\n+ Monitor NWS weather alerts for your area\n+ Choose how to be notified (lights, bell, vibrate)\n+ Modify notification based on NWS severity (go crazy for extreme alerts, such as Tornado Warning)\n+ Alerts keep updated automatically as long as you have connectivity\n+ Browse the alert list when there are multiple alerts, and read the details and instructions for the 2 MOST SEVERE alerts, as well as any EXTREME alerts.\n+ An app widget added to your home screen allows for easy on/off toggling of lights, vibrate and sound settings.  The alerts will still be checked and put on your status bar though, so you can keep an eye on it during class or church, without it causing distraction.\n+ Key words and phrases list. Create a list of words or phrases, and when an alert is received that contains those words or phrases, it will be marked in the alerts list with an icon, and the phrases will be highlighted when you read the alert details.\n+ Email an alert to friends or send via text message (requires Contacts List permission), so they can be warned as well.\n+ Post an alert on Facebook or your Twitter feed, to get the word out fast.\n+ Input your location by city, county, zip code, or let the app find your phone location by GPS or network location providers.\n\nYou can view the app manual here:\nhttp://android.globalcanofworms.com/guides/swa_pwa/Simple_Pro_Weather_Alert_Manual.html\n\nAn explanation of permissions:  The SMS and Contacts List permission are required so you can send an alert to someone via text message.  The contacts list permission allows for easier selecting of the number.\n\nIMPORTANT: While we take all possible precautions to make sure this app will get you critical alerts on time, the unforseen can still occur, as well as simple cell/network outages.  Thus, we do not recommend that you ever rely on this app ALONE for tornado warnings.  Please use this app along with other methods to ensure you are alerted in time.\n\nNOTE:  If you are certain the app is not sending you the alerts it should, please use Menu:Troubleshooting to send us debug info about it so we can work to resolve it quickly.\n\nIf you run into any other issues with this app or have questions, send us a note in the Menu:Troubleshooting screen.  Also, visit the developers blog on our website for a list of current issues we are addressing.\nThank you!"

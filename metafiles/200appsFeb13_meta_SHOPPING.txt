To make on-the-go shopping and price comparison even easier, the Amazon Mobile App includes helpful shopping features that allow users to scan a barcode, snap a photo, or type a search, to quickly compare prices and check availability. Customers can sign up to receive a daily notification for Lightning Deals and also stay up to date on status of their orders (US only).\n\nShoppers are able to access any of Amazon\'s sites around the world from a single app by simply selecting their desired Amazon country store. Amazon customers have full access to their existing cart, wish lists, payment and Amazon Prime member shipping options, order history, 1-Click settings and can also take advantage of Amazon.com\' Subscribe & Save (US only). All purchases made on Amazon Mobile are routed through Amazon\'s secure servers just as they are on the web.\n\n** Requires Android OS 2.0 & up and rear facing camera.\n \nImportant note regarding permissions. Amazon Mobile requires access to the following services to operate properly:\n \nLocation: due to the fact that this is now a world wide app, location permissions are required to support a delivery service feature offered by Amazon in France and Japan. Only in those stores is the location data required or used. In those locations you are able to request delivery to a convenience store closest to your current location. That service is not available in other Amazon countries.\n \nPhone calls: within the app you are able to place a call to Amazon Customer Service. Tap Menu -> More -> Help -> Call Customer Service, and we will place the proper number in the phone app and dial it.\n \nTake pictures: bar code scanning and image search require access to the camera function if you choose to start the bar code scanner from the app.\n \nAccount Permissions: This permission is used by the Amazon app suite for account authentication on select handsets."

We have acquired an LG Lucid and are working on a fix.\n\nVideo - We have re-encoded our videos, and are getting feedback that they are now playing for users that previously had issues. Please write into customer support if you are still having issues.\n\n----------\nPermissions We Request and Why\n----------\n\n* Hardware Controls - This gives us access to the camera so that you can take pictures of your receipts.\n\n* Your Location - In order to find schools near you that you may want to donate to, we need to know your current location. Location data is not currently used in any other capacity.\n\n* Network Communication - Ibotta must use your network in order to communicate with our servers. This is how we deliver offers, record your engagement responses, receive your receipts, etc. We also request permission to read the state of the network so that we can detect when internet is unavailable.\n\n* Read Your Contacts - In order to present a list of people that you may want to invite to use Ibotta, we must have permission to read your contacts. We do not use your contacts for any other purpose than this.\n\n* Storage - When you take a picture of your receipts, we need to store the image on disk temporarily until the receipts are completely uploaded, or you cancel out of the camera. We also request permission to check whether disk storage is accessible.\n\n* System Tools - In order to allow you to watch a video to completion without the phone going to sleep we must have this permission. It simply allows us to keep the screen on during video playback.\n\n* Your Accounts - We deliver system notifications to your device when we want to communicate newsworthy events, such as the status of one of your receipts or new offers. You have control over which notifications you want to receive in the Settings section of the app. Notifications are delivered through Google\'s Cloud Messaging (GCM) framework. In order to target your device for a notification, GCM, and therefore Ibotta, must know the account you are currently using."

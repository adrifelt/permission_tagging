BeyondPod also offers an option to automatically (1) Turn WiFi on, (2) Update your feeds, (3) Turn WiFi back off.\n\n* BeyondPod\'s integrated podcast player tracks what podcasts you have listened to, and supports automatically deleting podcasts at the end of playback to save space. There is also a configurable TiVo style \"commercial skip\" that lets you easily skip over content that you are not interested in.\n\n* BeyondPod\'s Smart Playlist automatically generates playlists based on your listening preferences. (For example:  First play the 2 newest podcasts of feed A, Then play the oldest podcast of Feed B. etc.). If you follow multiple podcasts Smart Playlist is an excellent way to always listen to what you want.\n\n* BeyondPod\'s Home Screen Widget gives you one-button access to your podcasts, SmartPlay, and SmartPlay updates directly from your phone\'s Home screen.\n\n* Integration with Google Reader allows you to easily import your Reader subscriptions.

Search for feeds, import feeds from a variety of popular directories, from Google Reader, or from external OPML files.\n\n* Import any local files (music, audio books, voice notes etc) and make them playable in BeyondPod audio/video player as if they were podcasts.\n\n* BeyondPod supports both wired headsets and Bluetooth receiver (via the AVRC profile).\n\n* Direct access to the LibriVox.org library with thousands of free audiobooks.\n\n* Use the Sleep feature to automatically turn the podcast playback off after predetermined period of time.\n\n* Supports Atom, RSS 2.0, RDF and OPML feeds."

This means you will receive all the words and pictures for that day\342\200\231s news on your app. You can then access this even when you have no phone signal.  \n\nWhen first connected (or unused for a long period), this app will conduct a complete sync with MailOnline to bring you all of our great news to your Android. After that, we will only download the pictures for the news, celebrity gossip, sport or other articles you download unless you change the Settings. \n\nYou can decide which parts of the app you would like to sync - and when - in the Settings screen. \n\n- Select a location \nYou can choose UK, US or Rest of the World and get the relevant News and Showbiz channels as your first two channels as well as all the other great channels such as Femail and Sport. You can change this at any time in the Settings section of the app.\n\n- Browse and read stories from your favourite channels\nYou can access all the latest news stories on our homepage.  There are also homepages for Showbiz, Femail and Sport.  These will update automatically.  You can choose other favourite channels by scrolling sideways through the channel navigation toolbar along the bottom of homepage and each channel homepage.\n\n- Easy to navigate\nYou can enjoy browsing great content, customise the app to always sync our favourite channels and share with friends. \n\nWhen viewing an article you swipe left and right to navigate to the next or previous news story.   You may also use the back button.  \n\n- Show me pictures! \nTap on the camera icons in an article to view all pictures in a story, the More Pictures link or tap on any thumbnail at the bottom of stories. Inside the gallery you can scroll or swipe your way through all the images that appear in a story.   \n\n- Reader comments\nYou can read and vote on reader comments and also post comments directly from the app!\n\n- Share with friends\nYou can share your favourite stories with friends, post on Facebook, Twitter or email them without leaving the app.\n\n- Your connection\nA Wi-Fi connection is fastest, has no data charges and also syncs all images at once. \n\nA 3G connection will also work fine, although this will be slightly slower and may incur data charges.  By default 3G is only set to sync images as you view them.  It will also only sync a limited number of channels until you access them.  You may like to change these defaults in Settings.\n\nEnjoy the Daily Mail Online app and get started today!\n\nIf you experience any problems with the app, please email us directly, androidapp@mailonline.co.uk"

    description: "Download the POLITICO for Android app today to get your politics fix. The clean, easy-to-navigate layout is ideal for staying up to date when you\342\200\231re on the go. POLITICO serves as the one-stop shop for the fastest, most in-depth coverage of the president, Congress, and election races. POLITICO\342\200\231s journalists break news and drive conversation about the White House, Capitol Hill and Washington lobbying, plus the intersection of politics with Wall Street, media and personalities. POLITICO launched in January 2007 with the mission of covering politics with enterprise, style and impact.\n\nKEY FEATURES:\302\240 \n\n\342\230\205 Use the \342\200\234Sections\342\200\235 button to navigate between several different POLITICO News, Blogs, Policy, Morning Tipsheets, and Videos\302\240categories, as well as Opinion, Photos, and user-Saved Articles.\n\n\342\230\205 Use the familiar swipe gestures to move between different articles within the same section.\n\n\342\230\205 Article videos are played in full-screen mode, with familiar overlay controls.\n\n\342\230\205 Article photo galleries are played in full-screen mode, with overlaid captions and credits. Use swipe gestures to move to the next or previous image in the gallery. Use the tap gesture to toggle between showing and hiding the caption and credit.  This view also supports rotation.\n\n\342\230\205 You can view Article text in one of three different sizes, so it\342\200\231s at your optimal reading size. To change the text size while viewing an Article, use your phone\342\200\231s Menu button to access the \342\200\234Font Size\342\200\235 option. Your desired setting is always remembered.\n\n\342\230\205 Article links to the source content on politico.com may be copied or shared with anyone via email, Twitter, or Facebook. You can also open them in the external browser app of your choice.\n\n\342\230\205 Current support for 4 types of push notifications. Users can enable/disable each type individually by accessing the Preferences via the phone\342\200\231s Menu button in the Sections list. The complete text of the last (unexpired) pushed notification is always downloaded for in-app viewing. When enabled, access the current notification by tapping the \342\200\234Alert\342\200\235 button in the Sections list.\n\n\342\230\205 POLITICO will dynamically deliver additional News, Blogs, or other feeds in the future, without requiring an app update.

The app will automatically check for changes several times every hour, and intelligently download only those changes that are different from the last downloaded content. If you want an immediate update, you can always use the pull-to-refresh mechanism built into every section front.\n\n\342\230\205 All downloaded non-video Article content is intelligently cached for offline reading when a network connection is not convenient.\302\240You can use the \342\200\234AUTO UPDATE\342\200\235 flags in the Sections list to control what and how much content we automatically download. Selecting a section that is not flagged for auto updating will only download that section upon demand when a network connection is available, otherwise we present the last downloaded version of that content, for offline reading.\n\n\342\230\205 Feedback is welcome and appreciated. \302\240You can email us directly from within the app by going to any article and using the \342\200\234Sharing\342\200\235 button and tapping on the \342\200\234Email POLITICO Feedback\342\200\235 item.\n\n\342\230\233 Follow us on Twitter: @POLITICO"

    description: "Now updated to the Tapatalk 2 back-end! If you have any questions, concerns or bugs, voice \'em here: http://goo.gl/SHk13\n\nThe easiest and best way to take part in the Android Forums at Android Central. Using the Tapatalk standard of mobile forum browsing, you can peruse forum threads, reply, start new threads, reply to PMs and do everything you expect from the best and friendliest Android forums around.\n\nThis app will ask your permission for some things when you install it. Here\'s what those permissions mean, in plain English:\n\nFull Internet access: You\'ll need to have access to the Internet to view and reply in the forums. Makes sense.\n\nRead phone state and identity: Google says this allows the app to know when a phone call is coming in. That way, the app can pause itself and let you answer the call. We\'re not using your identity for anything; these two permissions are bundled together.\n\nModify/delete USB and SD card contents: When you see a picture posted in the AC Forums via the app, it needs to store it on your internal storage or SD card. Again, makes sense.\n\nPrevent device from sleeping: When a notification is received (you can set those up in the app settings), the app will need to wake the device up so it can deliver it. (Yeah, it sounds a little backward.)\n\nControl vibrator: Needed for notifications, so you can have your phone or tablet vibrate. Sounds a little dirty, though.\n\nView network state/Wifi state: Because the app requires you to have a network connection, it needs to be able to *know* that you have a network connection. If you don\'t, it will tell you.\n\nAutomatically start at boot: The app will notify you about private messages and replies to subscribed topics. Without this permission, you would need to restart the app yourself each time you restart your phone to continue to get notifications.\n\nHope that helps clear up those scary, scary permissions. :p"

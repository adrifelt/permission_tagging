    description: "Ever found asking yourself \"Who Unfollowed Me on Twitter\" or \"Who Unfollowed Me on Instagram\"? JustUnfollow is the ultimate Twitter and  Instagram unfollow tracker and follow tracker. We help you find those who unfollow you on twitter and those who unfollow on Instagram and unfollow them back as well as find new followers and follow them.\n\nJustUnfollow is a simple Twitter and Instagram app to find people who unfollow you or don\'t follow you back.Find your fans, check if particular user follows you & whitelist non followers. I made this twitter & Instagram app because I wanted to find users who unfollowed me on twitter and who unfollowed me on Instagram. Finding people who unfollowed me was not easy and hence the idea to make a twitter app to \nsolve the problem.\n\nJustUnfollow quickly finds and displays all your Twitter unfollowers as well as Instagram unfollowers. Whether you have 100 users who unfollowed you or 10000 we will catch them and show them to you.\n\nIt\'s absolutely free to get started and find unfollowers. If you are searching for a bulk unfollow Twitter app or bulk unfollow Instagram app then you should know bulk unfollows aren\'t allowed by twitter and hence we do not provide that feature. You get to check and unfollow only those users that you want to.\n\nJustUnfollow aims to be the best and simplest application to manage twitter accounts and to help you find users who unfollowed you.\n\nKey Features (Twitter & Instagram have separate features):\n- Notifications: New followers and unfollowers will be tracked automatically and you will receive notifications(once in every 24 hrs)\n- Send automatic welcome DMs to new followers\n- Auto follow back new followers\n- Activate automatic tracking and tweeting of your stats\n- Non-Followers: Find and unfollow tweeps you follow who do not follow you back\n- Fans: Find and follow tweeps who follow you but you are not following them back\n- Who Unfollowed Me: Find tweeps who stopped following you\n- Who Followed Me: Find tweeps who started following you\n- Inactive Following: Find tweeps who haven\'t tweeted in the last 1,3 or 6 months\n- All Following: Shows and allows you to unfollow everyone you currently follow. Use this when you want to start twitter all over again!\n- Friend Check: Check your relationship with a particular twitter user\n- Whitelist: View all the users you have whitelisted. We make sure you do not end up unfollowing whitelisted users. Whitelist your favorite celebs\n- Blacklist: View all the users you have blacklisted. We make sure you do not follow blacklisted users\n- Copy Followers: Follow the followers of any other twitter account. Admire a twitter accounts follower? You can follow them using this feature\n- Multiple Accounts: Add multiple twitter accounts and manage them from a single place \n- Settings: Upgrade accounts (for Premium users) and all other app settings can be found here\n- Non-Followers for Instagram: Find and unfollow Instagram users you follow who do not follow you back\n- Fans for Instagram: Find and follow Instagram users who follow you but you are not following them back\n- Copy Followers for Instagram: Follow the followers of any other Instagram account. Admire a twitter accounts follower? You can follow them using this feature. This is one of the best ways to gain more followers on Instagram\n\n\nThis free version grants you access to all our features and lets you unfollow and follow users in the fastest way possible. You get to follow/unfollow up to 50 users per day for free on twitter and 60 users per hour for free on Instagram. In order to remove these limits or to add multiple twitter accounts to the same account, you can unlock these features within the app by clicking the \'Upgrade\' option. You cannot remove the Instagram unfollow limits as that limit is set by Instagram but you can upgrade to be able to add multiple Instagram accounts.\n\nWe\'re the best app for tracking Twitter and Instagram unfollowers and followers!\n\nContact us: info@justunfollow.com"

    description: "Join millions of other users on YouMail Visual Voicemail Plus!  \n\nYouMail is more powerful and more fun than any other Android visual voicemail.  And it\'s FREE!\n\nInterested in why we need certain permissions? We explain them all here:  http://go.youmail.com/AndroidPermit\n\nThis the newest version of the original YouMail that had between 500k and 1 million downloads, a 4+ rating from 8,692 people, and 2,568 reviews! \n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n- Scroll and play voice messages on any device: Android phone, Android tablet, computer, or e-mail account.\n   \n- Visual caller ID: see caller photos, name, and city and state, even when they\'re not in your address book - whether they left a message or just hung up.\n\n- Smart greetings: wow callers, automatically greeting them by name, or with a pre-recorded greeting from the YouMail greetings community. \n\n- Caller ditching: unwanted callers are sent to voicemail automatically, where they hear \"this number is out of service\" and can\'t leave a message!\n\n- Total ownership: easily save important messages forever, neatly organized in folders, and share them on twitter or facebook.\n\n- Easy contact backup and sync with facebook: access your contacts on any device.\n\n- High Quality Human-edited voicemail to text transcription: save time by simply reading your voicemail within the app or by e-mail, without ever having to listen to it (free trial).\n\nNOTES\n\n- Major US Carriers supported (including AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint). Sorry, doesn\'t work with pre-paid plans, such as T-mobile Flex-Pay, Simple Mobile, Family Mobile, and Virgin Mobile, and for most Metro PCS and Cricket users.\n\n- Requires you to forward your unanswered calls to YouMail.  To return to your old voicemail at any time, use \"menu\", \"preferences\", \"accounts\", and \"forward to carrier\" (or simply \"google\" cancel YouMail for instructions).\n\n- It\'s possible for carriers to drop your call forwarding.  To reactivate YouMail, just use \"menu\", \"preferences\", \"accounts\", and \"forward to YouMail\".\n\n- It\'s possible for carriers to fail to forward your calls to YouMail correctly (where YouMail won\'t find your mailbox or will ask for callers to enter the mailbox number).  In that case, please contact support@youmail.com and we will try to give you another access number that may not have the problem.  But it may be you live in an area where you\'re out of luck and would have to buy YouMail Pro to solve the problem.\n\n- High Quality Human edited voicemail-to-text transcription requires a subscription after the free trial is over, but YouMail Visual Voicemail Plus is still free to use if you do not buy a transcription plan. \n\n- By using YouMail you agree to the YouMail terms of service: http://www.youmail.com/termsofuse.html\n\n-Customer Support \nPlease email us at AndroidHelp@YouMail.com or go within the App, tap on Menu, and tap on Help. Leaving negative reviews with vague comments will not help us fix the app. We listen to our users, what\'s wrong, and fix all that we can with every new release. Help us help you!

    description: "Textie\342\204\242 Messaging is the unlimited text and photo messaging app for Android and iOS. If you and a friend are still paying to text each other, try using Textie Messaging instead\342\200\224and communicate for free.\n\nTextie lets you send messages to any other Textie user, any email address, and even to most U.S. mobile phones.* Replies come straight back to the app, so you can use Textie with anyone, whether they have Textie or not.\n\nTextie is beautiful, fast, and easy to use\342\200\224a natural extension to your Android phone.  All messages are free\342\200\224text and pictures.  Especially between two Textie apps, Textie offers an unparalleled user experience.\n\nThis full-featured version of Textie is sponsored by a seamless integration with Fusion Ads.  \n\n\nPRAISE FOR TEXTIE MESSAGING:\n\n  \"Stop texting until you\342\200\231ve tried it.\" -Gizmodo.com\n\n  \"4.5 mice!\" - MacWorld.com\n  \n  \"A great eye for design.\" -TechCrunch.com\n\n  \"This really is the Tweetie of messaging apps.\" -Horn Solo, User reviews\n\n\nFEATURES:\n\n\342\200\242\302\240Sends unlimited free messages to any Textie user, email address and most U.S. mobile phones\n\342\200\242\302\240Sends high quality photos to other Textie users or to any email\n\342\200\242 Installs free on Android, iPhone, iPad and iPod touch\n\342\200\242\302\240Can be installed on multiple devices simultaneously\n\342\200\242\302\240Naturally integrates with your existing address book contacts\n\342\200\242 Provides access to server-archived messages\n\342\200\242 Uses secure SSL for all connections\n\342\200\242 Uses battery-efficient Google C2DM Android push notifications (requires valid Google Market account credentials-- which you already have if you are downloading from the Android Market.)\n\n____________\n* For contacts outside the U.S., use email addresses or go Textie-to-Textie. Please see http://textie.me/sms to see full details on Textie\'s SMS capability, as not all non-Textie phones can receive free Textie messages. Textie works independently from your existing SMS plan and billing.\n\n\n\nDEVICE PERMISSIONS EXPLAINED:\n\nTextie is always respectful of your privacy and security.  Here is how it uses the Android permissions it requires.\n\n\342\200\242 Use the Authentication Credentials of an Account\n  Textie servers do not see your Google account information; the credentials are used only to enable the battery-efficient Google C2DM push messaging through the Android Market.\n\n\342\200\242 Full Internet Access / Receive Data From Internet / View Network State\n  Textie uses your internet connection to send an receive messages and photos, and occasionally to load small Fusion Ads.  No identifying information or message content is sent to Fusion Ads.\n\n\342\200\242 Read Contact Data / Write Contact Data\n Textie servers never see the contents of your address book.  When you receive messages, Textie locally displays the name and photo for the person from your contacts, and Textie sorts messages based on your contacts.  Textie can save new contacts if you tell it to.\n\n\342\200\242 Read Phone State and Identity\n  Textie uses the phone\'s android ID to sort out multi-device support with C2DM push messaging and for no other purpose.\n\n\342\200\242 Modify/Delete USB Storage Contents / Delete SD Card Contents\n  Textie stores photos you take using in a Textie directory on your phone.  Textie stores messages and photos locally in a database file on your phone.\n\n\342\200\242 Prevent Device From Sleeping\n  Textie may for a few seconds prevent the device from sleeping while the app is initially registering for C2DM push messages.\n\n\342\200\242 Discover Known Accounts\n  This is used only to enable Google C2DM push messaging. Textie servers do not see your account login information.\n\n\342\200\242 Control Vibrator\n  Textie can vibrate on new messages if the sound is off."

    description: "Puffin Web Browser is wicked fast. Once users experience the thrill of using Puffin, regular mobile Internet just feels like torture. Puffin Web Browser Free is the free version of the Puffin family.\n\n==== Top 5 Features ====\n\n* Incredible Load Speed\nSpeed is one of the most crucial aspects of mobile browsers. The Puffin Browser leverages a massive cloud computing data center to pre-process web pages and achieve page loading speeds that other browsers can only dream of. The remote-browser technology is so amazing that not only does it accelerate page rendering speed but also reduces network data usage. Puffin\'s speed is far superior to the built-in browsers, even more so on slower mobile connections.\n\n* Fastest JavaScript Engine\nYou know how fast Gmail is on your regular computer at home. Now, imagine running on a super fast server with 32 cores and 768GB memory and an Internet backbone with 10Gbps bandwidth and 1ms latency to major web sites. As a result, Puffin can execute JavaScript 5x faster than the closest competitors. Based on SunSpider JavaScript Benchmark, Puffin is 550% faster than the built-in browser on iPad 3, and 1600% faster than Chrome and other alternative browsers on the iOS platform. Additionally, Puffin is 500% faster than the latest & greatest Chrome on Nexus 7.\n\n* Full Web Experience\nMobile web browsers and mobile web sites are often designed to minimize mobile resource consumption. The tradeoffs leave regular mobile users with a severely limited mobile experience compared to the full web experience on their desktop browser. Even the latest Chrome browser running on the fastest Nexus 7 tablet cannot deliver full Gmail features like Puffin can. Instead, Gmail forces Chrome to switch to the mobile version even though users explicitly ask for the desktop version. Through Puffin\342\200\231s state-of-the-art cloud computing technology, mobile users are liberated from being second class Internet citizens. Our browsing experience gives mobile users first class citizens status with the same, full-featured websites they are used and entitled to.\n\n* Adobe Flash Support\nPeople, especially the smartest of all, say that mobile devices can\342\200\231t handle the burden of Flash, but we say otherwise. As a true believer of Think Different, we think your Internet experience should not be limited by your devices, nor by your wallet. The Puffin Browser encapsulates remote Flash technology to enlighten the mobile users to watch Flash videos, play Flash games, and tap into an endless sea of Flash content; all by running Flash on our servers. Flash performs so well that even low-end smart phones can display Flash content as smoothly as expensive devices.\n \n* Ingenious Virtual Mouse\nModern touchscreen devices have simple and intuitive user interfaces. Legacy desktop UI such as mouse-over and drag-&-drop are obsolete on mobile devices. However, modern web apps such as Gmail, competing against legacy desktop apps, delve deeper into desktop behaviors and rely more on the mouse cursor. Puffin Browser includes an ingenious virtual mouse technology to bridge the divergence of mobile and desktop experiences. Users can activate the trackpad through the virtual mouse at any time and use it just like a trackpad on laptops.\n\n==== Limitations ====\n\n* The data centers of Puffin Web Browser are in the US and the cloud servers can only access public web sites from US geolocations.\n\n* For users outside the US, local content, especially videos of local interest, may not be accessible from the US due to geo-restrictions in your home country.\n\n* For China users, Puffin has been blocked by the Great Firewall of China since 6/1/2012 due to censorship issues. Consequently, Puffin Web Browser is no longer sold in China.\n\n* For all users, we suggest trying the free version before buying the full version. At this moment in time, the only difference is the 2-week trial of Adobe Flash support for the free version."

The paid version has support for more vehicles and ECU types, looks a lot nicer, and works with more cars / trucks\n\nThe paid version has more features (HorsePower,Torque, 0-60 , quarter mile tests, graph data, map / track views) + no adverts and exra dial/display types! and better ABS / Knock sensor support, Transmission temperature support for some makes of car / trucks (GM / Ford, etc), and Turbo Boost on many more vehicles (including VW)\n\nWorks on vehicles made by Ford, GM/Vauxhall/Opel, Chrysler, Mercedes, Volkswagen, Audi, Jaguar, Citroen, Peugoet, Skoda, Kia, Mazda, Lexus, Daewoo, Renault, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Honda, Hyundai, BMW, Toyota, Seat, Dodge, Jeep, Pontiac, Subaru and many more vehicle makes, European, US, Far East, etc. Some vehicle ECUs may support more/less features than others.\n\n**PLEASE NOTE!** Any reports of hanging or freezing after quitting the app is due to a bug in the HTC Evo 4G and Galaxy Tab, this can be triggered by using the Pandora/Vlingo/Aldiko bluetooth enabled apps. Disabling Pandoras new bluetooth settings fixes the problem, but HTC/Samsung need to release a fix. Please contact their support and encourage them to fix, Thanks!\n\nThe pro version supports USB ELM adapters which are use \'Prolific\' or \'FTDI\' chips\n\n* Update: A freeze/hang workaround has been found after a great amount of effort and is available in the full version in the General Preferences settings!"

    description: "MailDroid is an ad-supported Webdav/POP3/IMAP Idle Push email client written from the ground up and and not based on the stock Android email client. \n\nPermissions needed for Ads\n\n*Features*\n1. Complete email re-write and not based at all on the standard Android mail client\n2. IMAP Idle Push for all IMAP email servers\n3. Save/Download Attachments from email to SD card using ES Explorer, Astro, or any other file explorer. You can also use the built in File Manager.\n4. Settings Support for signature, font size, ring tone, led color etc.\n5. Custom Mail Rules (like outlook and thunderbird)\n6. Spell Check\n7. Search your mail online (for IMAP only) or offline\n8. Password Protection\n9. Microsoft Exchange 2003,2007,2010, Office 365\n10. Full WYSIWYG editor\n11. Split screen for tablets\n12. Calendar integration\n13. Cloud storage integration (dropbox)\n14. Much more....\n\nACTIVESYNC IS NOT SUPPORTED!\n\n*FAQ*\n1. Why is the message slow to open? You need to set preload options found in global preferences.\n\n2. Why is Exchange not working? I support 2003,2007,2010 and Office 365. However, each one can be set up differently by your administrator. The usual issue is username which can be domain\\username, username, or username@domain.com\n\n3. I search, but see no results? You need to set up preloading in order to see search results.\n\n4. How can I have different notifications for sound and LED color? You can set this under the rules section in global preferences.\n\n5. Why can\'t I see my folders in Hotmail?

Talking Caller ID uses the built-in Android text-to-speech engine to voice the caller id when your phone rings.\n\nThe full (paid) version of Talking Caller ID is very configurable allowing you to customize it to voice the caller id only when you want it to.  While the free version is feature limited, the core functionality is present.  The paid version also removes the ads.\n\nTalking Caller ID is great for any hands-free environment.  Whether you receive calls while driving or you just don\'t feel like looking at your phone Talking Caller ID will tell you who\'s calling so you don\'t have to mess with your phone.\n\nKEY FEATURES (may not all be available in the free version):\n- Voices the caller id over your existing ringtone\n- Silent ringtone included if you only want to hear the speaking\n- Use for all calls, only calls from contacts, only calls from selected contacts, or only calls from non-contacts\n- Customizable start message let\'s you make it say whatever you like before the caller id\n- Customize the number of times it repeats\n- Customize voice pitch and speed\n\nGETTING HELP\nIf you are having trouble, please contact me.  Also, sending a debug log is very helpful when determining the root of the problem.  This is done by going to the menu in the app and choosing \'Get Help\'.  Then click the \'Send Log\' button."

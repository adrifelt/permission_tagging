    description: "For years ZEDGE\342\204\242 has been the most trusted and popular source of free ringtones and wallpapers in the world. Now ZEDGE\342\204\242 also offers free Games and Live Wallpapers. 40 million people get more than 200 million free downloads from Zedge every month. ZEDGE\342\200\231s brand is synonymous with high quality, diversity, uniqueness and great fun.\n\nCNET Editors\342\200\231 rating: \342\200\234Outstanding\342\200\235\n\342\200\234Overall, we think Zedge is a winner. It has a huge database of high-quality wallpaper, ringtones, and notification sounds, it\'s updated frequently, and it\'s incredibly simple to navigate.\342\200\235\n\nIn this app you\342\200\231ll be able to seamlessly download free, high quality Ringtones, Notification Sounds, HD Wallpapers and Live Wallpapers optimized for your device.\n\nZEDGE\342\204\242 recently added a Games channel where you\342\200\231ll also find cool, relevant and excellent games that you haven\342\200\231t seen before.  ZEDGE\342\204\242 makes sense of Google Play and suggests the games that are right for you.\n\nFEATURES\n\342\200\242 Set ringtones, notification sounds, wallpapers and live wallpapers directly from the app.\n\342\200\242 Find new games recommended just for you.\n\342\200\242 Start the games from within the app.\n\342\200\242 Supports default ringtone, contact ringtones, message tones, alarms, alerts and all types notifications.\n\342\200\242 Manage and organize downloaded items in your Downloads tab.\n\342\200\242 Live sync with your online favorites.\n\342\200\242 Setting for automatically changing wallpapers (auto change).\n\342\200\242 Widget for switching wallpapers.\n\342\200\242 Share your favorites with your friends.\n\342\200\242 ..and more.\n\nMillions of people have put their trust into ZEDGE\342\204\242 and we want to keep it that way. Here\'s the background on why we ask for certain permissions:\n\nNETWORK COMMUNICATION\nFULL INTERNET ACCESS\nWe need internet access to load content from our servers.\n\nYOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION\nREAD CONTACT DATA and WRITE CONTACT DATA\nWe need these permissions in order to set contact ringtones in the app. Without this it\'s impossible to offer the \"set as contact ringtone\" feature which many of you appreciate. We DO NOT read, transfer, store or use any of your personal information or contact data. This permission has always been required - we did not add it recently.\n\nSTORAGE\nMODIFY/DELETE USB STORAGE CONTENTS and MODIFY/DELETE SD CARD CONTENTS\nThis permission is required so you can store download from Zedge on your SD Card.\n\nNETWORK COMMUNICATION\nVIEW NETWORK STATE\nSince we are loading content from our servers you need to have an active network connection. This permission will allow us to see if you are connected or not.\n\nSYSTEM TOOLS\nSET WALLPAPER\nAllows you to set a wallpaper from within the app.\n\nSET PREFERRED APPLICATIONS\nWe need this permission to allow you to select Zedge as your default ringtone picker.\n\nFAQ:\nQ: I\342\200\231m not able to find popular music ringtones or mp3 music on Zedge. Why?\nA: Zedge respects that commercial artists normally want money for their music and that they don\342\200\231t want to give it away for free. We respect that. Zedge is not about music BUT about huge amounts of unique and rare stuff made and shared by people and independent artists from all parts of the world.\n\nRINGTONE CATEGORIES\nAlternative, Blues, Bollywood, Children, Christian & Gospel, Classical, Comedy, Country, Dance, Electronica, Entertainment, Games, Hip Hop, Holiday, Jazz, Latin, Message, Tones, News & Politics, Other, Pets & Animals, Pop, R&B / Soul, Reggae, Rock, Sayings, Sound Effects, World\n\nWALLPAPER CATEGORIES\nAbstract, Anime, Auto & Vehicles, Babes, Bollywood, Comedy, Designs, Drawn / Cartoons, Entertainment, Games, Holiday / Occasions, Themes, Hunks, Logos, Love, Music, Nature / Landscape, News & Politics, Other, People, Pets & Animals, Signs & Sayings, Spiritual, Sport, Technology\n\nTAGS\nwallpapers, hd wallpapers, live wallpapers, games, social games, backgrounds, background images, hd, theme, ringtones, ring tones, hd, contact ringtones, message tones, notification sounds, notifications, alarm sounds, alarms, alert sounds, alerts, tone, tones, sounds."

Also slower/older devices (shipped with Android OS below 2.1) can\'t run it too, currently it has been tested on Galaxy Nexus, Nexus 7 and Samsung Galaxy S3 so any mobile devices that is equivalent to them should run fine.\n\nIf you have put the app on SD card and restarted the phone, the wallpaper will reset to default since the system couldn\'t find the app first. \n\nFAQ:\n1. Why is there \"Internet access\" permission?\nIt is for Google ads on setting screen only, nothing else. Pro version is ads free with more features.\n\n2. Wallpaper resets to default after reboot/restart the phone?\nPlease move the app to phone instead of SD card.\n\nFollow us on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/xllusion\" target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/xllusion</a>"

    description: "The Ultimate iOS Style Launcher for Android.\n\nHere is the launcher you\'ve been waiting for. From the author of \"Fake iPhone 4S\" this brand new and improved version features all the visual styles of iOS 6.\n\nTrick your friends into thinking you have the new iPhone 5! This app is a full-screen working replica of the iPhone home screen. All your apps are easily accessible - just flip the screen across to view more pages.\n\nWorks best on the Samsung Galaxy S II, Galaxy S3, Galaxy Nexus or any Android phone with a Super AMOLED+ display. Also runs on the latest Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) & 4.1 (Jelly Bean) devices.\n\n--Features--\n* Most realistic iPhone skin on the market.\n* Fully functional home screen replacement.\n* Beautiful icon effects - all installed apps are styled.\n* Comes with 16 default apps on the first page.\n* Custom wallpapers supported!\n* Swipe-to-Search available - just swipe left at the main screen.\n\n--Frequently Asked Questions--\nQ. Is this just a screenshot of the iPhone, like other apps?\nA. No, this is a full working home screen replacement. When you press the Home button, you\342\200\231ll be taken straight back to this app. No more TouchWiz or HTC Sense! ;)\n\nQ. How do I switch back to my normal home screen?\nA. Press the \"Menu\" key on your phone, select \"Advanced\" and hit \"Switch Launcher...\"\n\nQ. Can I set my own wallpaper?\nA. Yes, you certainly can! Just press \342\200\234Menu\342\200\235 and then \342\200\234Choose Wallpaper...\342\200\235\n\nQ. Are there any ads?\nA. Yes. Advertising revenue helps support the future development of this app, so please bear this in mind :)\n\nWhenever you click an icon which fails to load for some reason (the app isn\'t installed on your phone, or Android encountered an error) an ad will be displayed instead. The ads are design to be non-intrusive and relevant. Generally you\'ll be offered a list of related apps which you might be interested in.\n\nQ. How is this different to Espier Launcher?\nA. Fake iPhone 5 is designed to be the most realistic iOS skin on the market. Espier supports a few more features, but doesn\'t look so good if you place it side-by-side with a real iPhone. We\'ve focussed on making a photo-realistic app to start with, and will be adding more features in future updates.\n\n---Feedback---\nI\'m open to ideas, so let me know if you have any suggested features or improvements. Either leave a comment, or shoot me an email at thebigbyte@gmail.com\n\nEvery email is read, and you will get a reply.\n\n--Privacy--\nThis app collects anonymous usage information via Google Analytics, and automatic error reports using ACRA. But rest assured, we don\'t store any personally identifiable information. We don\'t know what brand of toothpaste you use!\n\nAn example of some of the stuff we keep track of:\n* Number of daily users\n* Aggregate information about apps (including popular apps launched)\n* Frequently used menu items\n\nCollecting this data helps us continuously improve the app. If you\'re concerned about what might be collected, or have any questions please get in touch at thebigbyte@gmail.com\n\n---Permissions---\nThis app uses several external libraries, including Google Analytics, ACRA, LeadBolt and other ad networks.

    promoText: "The Ultimate iOS Style Launcher for Android.\n\nHere is the launcher you\'ve been waiting for. From the author of \"Fake iPhone 4S\" this brand new and improved version features all the visual styles of iOS 6.\n\nTrick your friends into thinking you have the new iPhone 5! This app is a full-screen working replica of the iPhone home screen. All your apps are easily accessible - just flip the screen across to view more pages.\n\nWorks best on the Samsung Galaxy S II, Galaxy S3, Galaxy Nexus or any Android phone with a Super AMOLED+ display. Also runs on the latest Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) & 4.1 (Jelly Bean) devices.\n\n--Features--\n* Most realistic iPhone skin on the market.\n* Fully functional home screen replacement.\n* Beautiful icon effects - all installed apps are styled.\n* Comes with 16 default apps on the first page.\n* Custom wallpapers supported!\n* Swipe-to-Search available - just swipe left at the main screen.\n\n--Frequently Asked Questions--\nQ. Is this just a screenshot of the iPhone, like other apps?\nA. No, this is a full working home screen replacement. When you press the Home button, you\342\200\231ll be taken straight back to this app. No more TouchWiz or HTC Sense! ;)\n\nQ. How do I switch back to my normal home screen?\nA. Press the \"Menu\" key on your phone, select \"Advanced\" and hit \"Switch Launcher...\"\n\nQ. Can I set my own wallpaper?\nA. Yes, you certainly can! Just press \342\200\234Menu\342\200\235 and then \342\200\234Choose Wallpaper...\342\200\235\n\nQ. Are there any ads?\nA. Yes. Advertising revenue helps support the future development of this app, so please bear this in mind :)\n\nWhenever you click an icon which fails to load for some reason (the app isn\'t installed on your phone, or Android encountered an error) an ad will be displayed instead. The ads are design to be non-intrusive and relevant. Generally you\'ll be offered a list of related apps which you might be interested in.\n\nQ. How is this different to Espier Launcher?\nA. Fake iPhone 5 is designed to be the most realistic iOS skin on the market. Espier supports a few more features, but doesn\'t look so good if you place it side-by-side with a real iPhone. We\'ve focussed on making a photo-realistic app to start with, and will be adding more features in future updates.\n\n---Feedback---\nI\'m open to ideas, so let me know if you have any suggested features or improvements. Either leave a comment, or shoot me an email at thebigbyte@gmail.com\n\nEvery email is read, and you will get a reply.\n\n--Privacy--\nThis app collects anonymous usage information via Google Analytics, and automatic error reports using ACRA. But rest assured, we don\'t store any personally identifiable information. We don\'t know what brand of toothpaste you use!\n\nAn example of some of the stuff we keep track of:\n* Number of daily users\n* Aggregate information about apps (including popular apps launched)\n* Frequently used menu items\n\nCollecting this data helps us continuously improve the app. If you\'re concerned about what might be collected, or have any questions please get in touch at thebigbyte@gmail.com\n\n---Permissions---\nThis app uses several external libraries, including Google Analytics, ACRA, LeadBolt and other ad networks. Some of these libraries require additional permissions.\n\n* SET_WALLPAPER and SET_WALLPAPER_HINTS are necessary to set & retrieve the home screen wallpaper\n* INTERNET_ACCESS, ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE and ACCESS_WIFI_STATE are required for Google Analytics, ACRA and advertising networks.\n* READ_PHONE_STATE, WAKE_LOCK and RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED are required for advertising networks (currently interstitials, and push notifications may be enabled in future)\n* WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE is required to cache error reports before transmission, and for rich media ads\n\n---Trademarks---\niPhone is a trademark of Apple Computer Inc. This app is not affiliated with or endorsed by Apple."
    recentChanges: "NEW! Option to set 4 rows or 5 rows of apps!\n\n** If you like the app, please rate 5 stars **\nWe read all the 5 star comments every day :)\n\nVersion 1.3 (25th September):\n+ Fixed Music app on Huawei phones\n+ New high-resolution icons!\n+ Bugfixes & enhancements\n\nVersion 1.2 (15th September):\n+ Improved dock functionality (Mail, Safari & Music)\n+ Option to choose number of rows\n+ Set default Mail action to Gmail\n\nIf you like the app, please hit the \"+1\" button & leave a comment - it\'ll help a lot :)"

    description: "\342\230\205 200+ Free Fonts \342\230\205\n\nStarrLite Designs brings you Font SMS Pro, a third-party supplement to the popular apps:\n\n\342\231\246 GO SMS Pro\n\342\231\246 GO Launcher EX\n\342\231\246 GO Keyboard\n\342\231\246 Handcent SMS\n\342\231\246 chompSMS. \n\nWithin it are 200+ beautiful fonts which can make your text messaging experience more personal and unique.\n\nWe update this library frequently with premium fonts from www.fontsquirrel.com.\n\n\342\230\205 Themes \342\230\205\n\nIf you enjoy the intricacies of phone customization, then you may enjoy some of the stylish GO SMS Pro themes that we\'ve designed. See our developer account for the available choices (they\'re all free).\n\n\342\230\205 Monetization \342\230\205\n\nWe are currently using Airpush, Inc as the exclusive ad company for this app. You will receive push notifications periodically. We\'re working on a solution for an easy opt-out, but for now this is how we fund our development as an indie app group. Thank you for your understanding and support.\n\n\342\230\205 Ratings \342\230\205\n\nWe work hard to bring freemium products to the Android market and genuinely appreciate all ratings and feedback. Let us know how we\'re doing. Thanks!\n\n\342\230\205 Directions - Scroll Through to Desired Section \342\230\205\n\n\342\230\206 To Apply to Text Messenger \342\230\206\n\n1.) Open up your favorite text messenger. Either: Go SMS Pro, Handcent SMS, or chompSMS.\n\n2.) Locate the \'Scan for font packages\' feature. This will be located in the customization or style menu. Here are the specific paths:\n\nHandcent SMS:\n\nMenu => Settings => Custom style => \'Scan external font package\'\n\nChomp SMS:\n\nMenu => Settings => Customize Look => Custom Font Packs => \'Custom Font Packs\'\n\nGO SMS Pro:\n\nMenu => Settings => Advanced => Appearance Settings => \'Scan font packages\'\n\n3.) Scan for font packages. Note: Sometimes it will not appear to detect them, but it has.\n\n4.) Try to change a font. Change the package to \'Font SMS (Pro)\'. All of the fonts that you see in Font SMS (Pro) will be available to you there.\n\n5.) Please consider re-rating our app, given its new capability to disable all Airpush ads.\n\n\342\230\206 To Apply to Entire Phone (must have GO Launcher EX) \342\230\206\n\nNow when we say \"entire phone\", we mean to the extent that GO Launcher EX allows, which is pretty extensive. You will definitely have that customized feel after applying our fonts.\n\n1.) If you are all about customizing your phone, then you probably already have the GO Launcher app. If not, you need to get this to apply our fonts to entire phone.\n\n2.) Go to Menu => Preferences => Visual Settings => Font in GO Launcher.\n\n3.) Now press the \'Scan font\' button.\n\n4.) Press the \'Select Font\' feature. Our fonts are included in the package called \'Font SMS (Pro)\'. We hope you enjoy them. We personally think they look fantastic in GO Launcher.\n\n\342\230\206 Apply to GO Keyboard \342\230\206\n\nAdvanced Settings => Font Settings => Scan Fonts => Select Fonts\n\nThe fonts you see in Font SMS (Pro) will be available there.\n\n\342\230\205 Troubleshoot \342\230\205\n\n1.) When you switch a theme, sometimes you must reset the font you have chosen. Simply, change the font again. This is something the text messenger does, not Font SMS (Pro).\n\n2.) When in doubt, please email: starrlitemedia@gmail.com, to work with the lead developer directly.\n\nThanks to our supportive users,\nSincerely,\n\nStarrLite"

Also slower/older devices (shipped with Android OS below 2.1) can\'t run it too, currently it has been tested on Samsung Galaxy S3, Galaxy Nexus and Sony Arc S so any mobile devices that is equivalent to them should run fine. \n\nIf you have put the app on SD card and restarted the phone, the wallpaper will reset to default since the system couldn\'t find the app first. \n\nFAQ:\n1. Why is there \"Internet access\" permission?\nIt is for Google ads on setting screen only, nothing else. Pro version is ads free with more features.\n\n2. Wallpaper resets to default after reboot/restart the phone?\nPlease move the app to phone instead of SD card."

Phone Settings > Applications > Manage Applications, choose Launcher Pro, select \'Clear Data\' and then try to load the icons again.\n\n\342\230\205If you are having trouble - EMAIL US!

Also slower/older devices (shipped with Android OS below 2.1) can\'t run it too, currently it has been tested on Nexus S, HTC Desire and Samsung tab so any mobile devices that is equivalent to them should run fine.\n\nIf you have put the app on SD card and restarted the phone, the wallpaper will reset to default since the system couldn\'t find the app first. \n\nFAQ:\n1. Why is there \"Internet access\" permission?\nIt is for Google ads on setting screen only, nothing else. Pro version is ads free with more features.\n\n2. Wallpaper resets to default after reboot/restart the phone?\nPlease move the app to phone instead of SD card.\n\nFollow us on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/xllusion\" target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/xllusion</a>"

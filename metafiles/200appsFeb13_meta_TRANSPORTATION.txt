    description: "** CNET says: \"...Siri has breadth, but Robin has depth\" ! **\n\nNeed quick answers on the go, hands-free? Robin is your voice assistant for local information, GPS navigation, communication and fun! And she\'ll help keep your eyes on the road and off your perfectly-formed phone. Voice in, voice out. \n\nUsers say: \342\200\234After trying Speaktoit, Vlingo, AIVC Pro, Iris, and Skyvi \342\200\246Robin is the best voice app of its kind; clearly the best choice for drivers in need of information on the road.\342\200\235\n** Endorsed by TechCrunch, CNET, Wired, Lifehacker, etc. **\n\nAsk Robin for directions & local places, parking & traffic, your Facebook & Twitter news, gas prices & weather, reminders & alarms, text messages & jokes and much more. \nRobin is a personal assistant that can be both useful and fun, constantly learning and adapting to you. She\'ll even call you whatever names you want! Just tap the microphone button, and Robin will be all ears. Even after launching other apps, Robin is still there for you - just \"wave hello\" twice in front of your phone\342\200\231s upper edge (or brush/tap it lightly).  \n\nCompare to voice apps such as Siri, Nuance, Dragon Go, Vlingo, Evi, Voice Actions, VoiceSearch, SpeakToIt, Iris, Skyvi, Text by Voice and other personal assistants, as well as GPS navigation such as Waze, Telenav, MapQuest, Navigon, Garmin, TomTom, MotionX, Yelp, etc.\n\nNotes \n----------------------------\n\342\200\242  Robin is currently in Beta, she\'s still a student. But that also means you can watch her intelligence evolve daily and even get to contribute a little. Come be a part of the experience!\n\342\200\242  Gesture activation: normally, you just need to wave your hand twice close to the top edge of your phone. For best results, we recommend using the \"double-brush\" gesture, where your hand actually touches the phone lightly. Certain devices require specific tuning - we are working down that list as we speak.\n\342\200\242  Permissions: Robin will never email your contacts without your knowledge! It does need a permission to access you calendar for reminders reminders, and to your GMail in case you want email narration \342\200\223 that\342\200\231s all. The wording Google Play uses can be misleading. \n\342\200\242  Trouble with a particular location? Missing point of interest? Any issue at all? For best results, give your feedback to Robin right from within the app, so we have more information to actually fix the issue ASAP. See what people say about our speed to address reported issues.  \n\nQUESTIONS? COMMENTS? COMPLAINTS?\nEmail us (see below) or submit feedback to Robin right in the app. You can also contact us on Twitter @robinmagnifis, or on Robin\342\200\231s FB page!\n\nhttps://twitter.com/#!/RobinMagnifis\nhttps://www.facebook.com/RobinCommunity\n\n\n\nExamples of useful commands \n----------------------------\n\nPlaces \n\342\200\242  Where is the nearest Macy\'s?... Can I park there?  \n\342\200\242  Find Thai restaurants in SF... How about French?  \n\342\200\242  Find a burger place ... Does it have a good rating?  \n \nParking\n\342\200\242  Where can I park? \n\342\200\242  Find cheapest parking around Union Square \n\342\200\242  Anything closer/cheaper? \n\342\200\242  Can I reserve it?.. Let\342\200\231s go there! \n\nNavigation\n\342\200\242  Go to 1234 Lombard San Francisco  \n\342\200\242  Get me to Getty Museum   \n\342\200\242  Directions to Hollywood and Highland \n\nTraffic\n\342\200\242  What is the traffic like near Hollywood?\n\nGas Prices\n\342\200\242  Where is the cheapest gas in Santa Monica?  \n\nWeather\n\342\200\242  What\'s the weather like in San Diego tomorrow?   \n\342\200\242  Is it snowing in Moscow?  \n\nFacebook & Twitter\n\342\200\242  Read my Twitter feed \n\342\200\242  Update Facebook \n\nReminders\n\342\200\242  Remind me to exercise tonight!  \n\nMisc\n\342\200\242  Tell me a joke! \n\n\nKeywords: voice assistant, voice recognition, magnifis, siri, assistant, virtual assistant, siri for android, artificial intelligence,  voice to text, text by voice, traffic, navigation, kitt, valet, driver, parking, directions, voice navigation, local search, Yelp, butler."

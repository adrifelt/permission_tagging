ALL features are available during the trial period except the ability to change the signature on outgoing emails.\n\nNow your Android tablet comes closer to Outlook when it comes to the user experience.\n\nWhen it comes to corporate data access on your device, you get what you pay for. For a fair comparison, compare the download counts along with the stars.\n\nNitroDesk, Inc. has been building and improving TouchDown since October 2008. We have improved the product through hundreds of internal versions, to bring you the best and most downloaded Email solution for Android. \n\nComprehensive : Support for most number of data types (Email, Calendar, Contacts, Tasks) and Notes and SMS syncing for Exchange 2010 servers. \n\nCustomizable : Dozens of options to make the app behave just the way you want. Custom notifications, speech notifications, viewing tweaks, pinch-to-zoom, peak times and many more.\n\nSD card support : Move your data to the SD card if necessary\n\nWidgets : Email, Tasks, Calendar, Universal Widgets make it easy for you to see your status at a glance. Support for third party widgets give you a wide range of choice\n\nMost Secure: TouchDown supports exchange activesync policies such as PIN, Remote Wipe, Data encryption and Storage card encryption of corporate data. Hundreds of organizations trust TouchDown to ensure security, privacy and confidentiality of their data. Discerning organizations mandage the use of TouchDown to ensure high usability along with security. \n\nCorporate Data Separation: TouchDown keeps your corporate data separate from your personal data. Without TouchDown, your employer can actually flatten your phone to factory defaults. With TouchDown, they can only remove corporate data belonging to them, leaving behind your personal information. \n\nS/MIME: TouchDown is the only android solution so far that supports sending and receiving S/MIME signed and encrypted emails. S/MIME signing and encryption ensures that your emails are not tampered with, and can ensure that emails you send can be ensured to be visible only to the intended recipient.\n\nManageable : TouchDown integrates with most popular Mobile Device Management solutions in the market today, increasing the chances that your phone can play well with your IT organization\'s security policies."

    description: "No credit card required, no limits to number of documents, no registration necessary, no advertising, just FREE. \n\nKey Features:\n * Natural signing experience like pen on paper \342\200\224 While signing on the screen the signature is displayed without delay and accurately like signing with a pen on paper. The app fully supports Android-powered tablets which are equipped with an active stylus pen. (e.g. Samsung Galaxy Note, Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet, HTC Jetstream and HTC Flyer)\n\n* Forensically identifiable signatures \342\200\224 SIGNificant records the signature of a person using all available parameters, such as acceleration, speed, and rhythm. If there is a dispute about a captured signature, an expert tool is available to forensically analyze the biometric characteristics of the captured signature. \n\n* Document Binding \342\200\223 When a signature, including all these biometric parameters, is captured locally on the device, it is safely embedded using an asynchronous public key encryption into and uniquely bound to the target PDF document. Copy/paste attacks can thus be easily detected.\n\n* Add attachments \342\200\224 Add scans of driving license, passport or any other photo out of your photo gallery. If your tablet has a camera you are able to attach any current photo.\n\n* Typewriter \342\200\224 Lets you enter text anywhere on a PDF document. It is useful for typing on a non-fillable form or outside the fillable areas of a form.\n\n* Browse Through Multipage Documents \342\200\223 Browse and review multipage documents before you sign them. Especially useful for field agents to get documents signed in person, in real time, by presenting a document to a client on a tablet.\n\n* Email support - After e-signing, you email your document right back from the App.\n\n* Support for cloud storage - SIGNificant utilizes the \342\200\234Open\342\200\235 functionality to allow you to open a document from most other applications that have documents and contracts in them \342\200\223 including your inbox, Dropbox, Evernote, Box(.net) and others \342\200\223 and sign them via SIGNificant on the go. When you are finished you can store and share documents via your cloud storage.\n\n* Adobe Acrobat compatible PDF \342\200\224 The document is Adobe Acrobat compatible, so it can be viewed by any standard PDF viewer. PDF documents are sealed with a digital signature compliant to the ISO-Standards for PDF. Thus the validity of the digital signature can be validated with Adobe Reader and many other PDF viewers.\n\n* Customization / SDK \342\200\224 Enterprises can utilize the xyzmo infrastructure and launch their own e\342\200\223signature application, as well as integrate the functionality of SIGNificant into their own apps (The apps are also available as SDK).\n \nPlease note that an internet connection is required to e-sign a document with SIGNificant, because your documents are processed online on our servers. SIGNificant works best over WiFi or high speed cellular data. It might be slow over EDGE.\n\nIMPORTANT:\nIf you have problems when signing or saving the document, go to preferences and set the value for graphics-resolution to the lowest possible!\n\n\nAsk a question /Share an idea / Report a problem via: http://getsatisfaction.com/xyzmo\n\nxyzmo delivers SIGNificant Signature Capture for free to all, and offers additional inexpensive, high-value apps for enterprise or power users who want a little more. Please contact us at sales@xyzmo.com if you are interested in our enterprise version. Alternatively you can call us at +1-201-205-291-8 or +43-7229-88060.\n\nTags:\ndigital signatures, digitized signatures, digital signature, electronic signatures, electronic signature, esign, e-signature, e sign, signature pad, capture signature, signatures digital, firma biometrica, xyzmo, significant, PDF,"

Contact your IT department for further assistance.\n\nWORK THE WAY YOU WANT TO\n\nWork on your Windows based VMware View virtual desktop right from your Android device giving you on the go access from any location. Support for the PCoIP display protocol means your desktop is fast and responsive regardless of where you are.\n\nBEST OF BOTH WORLDS\n\nFeel right at home with support for native Android gestures for quick and easy navigation around your desktop. Need to do something more complex? Call up the trackpad for better mouse targeting or the keyboard for efficient text input.\n\nSIMPLE CONNECTIVITY\n\nTightly integrated with the VMware View for simple setup and connectivity. Quickly reconnect to you desktop by selecting from the recent desktop list. Even easier with the newly integrated RSA soft token, you don\'t even need to leave the VMware View client to enter your RSA token for login.\n\nUNMATCHED PERFORMANCE\n\nThe adaptive capabilities of the PCoIP protocol are optimized to deliver the best user experience even over low bandwidth and high latency connections. Improved performance available with VMware View 5 and later.\n\nSECURE FROM ANY LOCATION\n\nAt your desk or away from the office you\342\200\231re always secure. Access your View desktop over WiFi or 4G/LTE and with tight VMware View integration your desktop is delivered securely \n\nNOTE REGARDING NEW APPLICATION PERMISSIONS: When you install VMware View Client, you will now be prompted to allow the app read phone status and identity. This permission is due to the newly integrated RSA SDK and the RSA soft token feature. For security purposes, the RSA SDK requires access to the phone state, device\'s network state and Wi-Fi state in order to verify the device\'s identity. The VMware View Client does NOT collect or store any personal data. \n\nFor more information, refer to RSA FAQ: http://www.rsa.com/android/help120.htm\n\nFEATURES\n\n1. Supports VMware View 4.6.1, 5.0 and later brokers\n\n2. PCoIP only connectivity for excellent interactive performance\n\n3. Optimized user experience for Android tablets\n\n4.

It allows opening office productivity application documents located in the filesystem, e.g. on sd card, as well downloaded documents, files on Dropbox, or documents files attached to an email. It offers zooming in and out of documents, searching inside documents as well as copying text from documents. And it even offers reading text documents (.odt, .sxw, .docx) aloud.\n\nThe following file formats are currently supported:\n- OpenOffice.org 2.x and 3.x formats: .odt (Writer), .ods (Calc), .odp (Impress) \n- OpenOffice.org 1.x formats: .sxw (Writer), .sxc (Calc) (no support for embedded images)\n- Microsoft Office 2007 formats: .docx (Word), .xlsx (Excel), .pptx (Powerpoint)\n- Other formats: .txt (plain text), .csv (comma-separated values)\n\nPlease note that some restrictions apply for viewing documents:\n- Displaying the document is done via a conversion to HTML, which is why the document will look differently than if viewed with a desktop office productivity application\n- Large files will take very long to open, or sometimes not open at all\n- When displaying images, only those images will be shown where the image format is supported by the Android browser\n- Password-protected documents cannot be opened\n\nAd-supported version, need to be online when viewing documents, so that ads can be loaded. Permissions required for displaying the ads.\n\nIf you are smart and you like this app, please rate it. If you are smart and don\'t like it, please send me an email to tell me what should be improved. Not so smart people may simply give a bad rating and/or use swear words in the comments and/or complain about \"missing\" features the software never promised to have...\n\n\nKeywords: OpenOffice LibreOffice MS Office document reader viewer Open Document Format ODF text-to-speech TTS"

A HUD property is a residential property acquired by HUD as a result of a foreclosure action on an FHA-insured mortgage.

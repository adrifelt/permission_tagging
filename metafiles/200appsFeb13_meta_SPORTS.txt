Sports app - Simple, fast and in-depth sports scores and news.\n\nThe best way to follow all of your favorite teams, with coverage of MLB, NFL, NCAA College Football, NBA, NCAA Men\'s and Women\'s Basketball, NHL, PGA golf, Premier League, NASCAR, Tennis and more.  Live play-by-play, stats, standings and news, plus live score alerts and widget support.\n\nReminder: Widgets are unavailable if you put the app on your SD card\n\nGet the power and depth of Yahoo! Sports, one of the leading sources of sports information on the Web, as an app for your Android device. Yahoo! Sportacular is chock full of all the breaking news, scores, schedules, and details that sports fans crave.\nThis app crams so much into one small package, it\'s borderline ridiculous. No matter what\'s going on in the world of sports, you\'ve got the details right at your fingertips, wherever you are.\nSportacular covers the gamut of major sports. NCAA football and basketball? Check. Pro baseball, basketball, football, hockey, and soccer (domestic and foreign)? All accounted for. Golf, tennis, and auto sports? But of course. There are even categories for your self-selected Favorite Teams and Trending Games.\nFor example: Are you a Major League Baseball fan? Get the latest game scores, both finals and ongoing, with a few touches of the screen. Then go deeper. See the linescore, a scoring summary, winning and losing pitcher, and team records. Tap on the Stats page to see the complete boxscore. There\'s even a play-by-play accounting of the entire game. This kind of detail is available for just about any sport you can think of in this deep app.\nSelect the Team option from the menu and it opens up a new screen with tabs for Team Info, News, Schedule, and Settings. Use the latter to create adjustable alerts for your favorite teams: game start, game end, score change, quarter or inning change, etc. You can have the app send you noise or vibrate notifications, so you\'ll know when to get to a TV, pronto.\nOf course, there\'s always something new coming out of the sports world, whether it\'s a player injury, trade, team scandal, or just a star\'s latest weird tweet. Sportacular pulls in links to the top stories from sources such as Fox, ESPN, Yahoo!, The Sporting News, league websites, and more. Share the hot-off-the-presses news and scores with your friends via e-mail or social media.\nSportacular lists the latest odds on each game. But just for fun, there\'s also an interactive feature available for most games in the app: a live poll of fans regarding who will win that contest. As soon as you make your pick, you\'ll see what percentage of people agree with you and how many think you\'re all wet, complete with a U.S. regional breakdown of the voting. There\'s also a Check-In section where you can make comments about the game and post them to Facebook, so you can trash talk to your heart\'s content. After all, you know the score.\nPrivacy: http://www.citizensportsinc.com/inc/privacy.html"

It analyzes the weather, sun and moon position, moon phase, and many other factors to determine where fish will be located, how active they will be, and what lures, baits and presentations will be most effective.  Select when you\'ll be fishing, pick your location by GPS or on the map, select the type of body of water, water conditions, and what species you want to catch.  See the best fishing days and times based on forecasted weather water temperature, spawning related behavior, solunar factors and more.  My Fishing Advisor will guide you as you select the structure and cover to fish, and what type, size, and color of lure or bait.  It will even help you select the right line and details like sinker weights, hook sizes, etc.\n\nCurrently supports these species:\n\nLargemouth Bass\nSmallmouth Bass\nStriped Bass\nWhite Bass\nNorthern Pike\nMusky\nWalleye\nYellow Perch\nCrappie\nBluegills & Sunfish\nChannel Catfish\nFlathead Catfish\nBlue Catfish\nWhite Catfish\nCarp\nRainbow Trout\nBrown Trout\nBrook Trout\nLake Trout\n\nThis is the first mobile app to use this technology, previously used in a tournament-winning Windows software package for anglers.  The first release is intended primarily for use in the continental United States.  More species and improved support for other regions will be included in upcoming versions.\n\nMy Fishing Advisor is currently free and ad-supported.  A paid ad-free version is planned for the near future.\n\nIf you encounter problems with My Fishing Advisor, please let us know at info@myfishingadvisor.com.  We\'ll respond quickly to fix any issues we can, but we can only do that if you let us know the details of the issue.  Thanks, and happy fishing!"

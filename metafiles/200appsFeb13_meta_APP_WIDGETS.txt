Here\'s the background on why we ask for certain permissions:\n\nNETWORK COMMUNICATION\nFULL INTERNET ACCESS\nWe need internet access to load content from our servers.\n\nYOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION\nREAD CONTACT DATA and WRITE CONTACT DATA\nWe need these permissions in order to set contact ringtones in the app. Without this it\'s impossible to offer the \"set as contact ringtone\" feature which many of you appreciate. We DO NOT read, transfer, store or use any of your personal information or contact data. This permission has always been required - we did not add it recently.\n\nSTORAGE\nMODIFY/DELETE USB STORAGE CONTENTS and MODIFY/DELETE SD CARD CONTENTS\nThis permission is required so you can store download from Zedge on your SD Card.\n\nNETWORK COMMUNICATION\nVIEW NETWORK STATE\nSince we are loading content from our servers you need to have an active network connection. This permission will allow us to see if you are connected or not.\n\nSYSTEM TOOLS\nSET WALLPAPER\nAllows you to set a wallpaper from within the app.\n\nSET PREFERRED APPLICATIONS\nWe need this permission to allow you to select Zedge as your default ringtone picker.\n\nFAQ:\nQ: I\342\200\231m not able to find popular music ringtones or mp3 music on Zedge. Why?\nA: Zedge respects that commercial artists normally want money for their music and that they don\342\200\231t want to give it away for free. We respect that. Zedge is not about music BUT about huge amounts of unique and rare stuff made and shared by people and independent artists from all parts of the world.\n\nRINGTONE CATEGORIES\nAlternative, Blues, Bollywood, Children, Christian & Gospel, Classical, Comedy, Country, Dance, Electronica, Entertainment, Games, Hip Hop, Holiday, Jazz, Latin, Message, Tones, News & Politics, Other, Pets & Animals, Pop, R&B / Soul, Reggae, Rock, Sayings, Sound Effects, World\n\nWALLPAPER CATEGORIES\nAbstract, Anime, Auto & Vehicles, Babes, Bollywood, Comedy, Designs, Drawn / Cartoons, Entertainment, Games, Holiday / Occasions, Themes, Hunks, Logos, Love, Music, Nature / Landscape, News & Politics, Other, People, Pets & Animals, Signs & Sayings, Spiritual, Sport, Technology\n\nTAGS\nwallpapers, hd wallpapers, live wallpapers, games, social games, backgrounds, background images, hd, theme, ringtones, ring tones, hd, contact ringtones, message tones, notification sounds, notifications, alarm sounds, alarms, alert sounds, alerts, tone, tones, sounds."

    description: "Flashlight app for your device! Incredibly simple and yet very useful flashlight application. Will use your device\'s camera LED / flash / screen as a torch.\n\nTiny Flashlight is currently the best led flashlight app on the Android Market, because:\n\n - It supports the widest range of devices with camera flashlight (led flash)\n - It\'s also the brightest flashlight / torch, because of the camera flashlight, which emits very intense light in the dark. \n - Has different widgets to choose from\n - Has great and diverse screen lights\n - Has the best flashlight support\n - The best tablet app\n - Free of Charge\n\nLight sources:\n==============\n\n * Camera LED flashlight - Uses your phone\'s camera flashlight to emit bright light. Note that some devices don\'t have a camera flashlight. In this case the led flashlight option will be disabled, but you can still use one of the screen lights.\n\n * Screen Light - This is the basic white screen flashlight, which is bright enough for daily use. You can use it as your primary flashlight option in case your device doesn\'t have a camera flashlight or you want to save the battery.\n\n * Warning Lights, Police Lights, Color Flashlight, Strobe Flashlight, Morse Code, Text to Morse, Manual Morse Code, Camera Light - Different light sources, which may be useful in many situations. You can change the brightness and the colors.\n\nThe Best Free Flashlight app when you need reliability, functionality, and lights diversity\n\nCAUTION: Strobe lighting can trigger seizures in photosensitive epilepsy!\n\nFlashlight Widget and Lock Screen widgets:\n========\nTiny Flashlight is one of the few applications on the android market, which is free and has different widgets to choose from when the device has an option for a led flashlight. Also, Tiny Flashlight supports the newly added lockscreen widgets in Android 4.2 and later.\n\nFlashlight Permissions:\n============\nWhy Tiny Flashlight needs so many permissions and how are they used:\n\n* TAKE PICTURES AND VIDEOS (CAMERA flashlight)\n - In order to start the camera flashlight on some devices, Tiny Flashlight has to use a small part of the camera hardware and it needs this permission. Don\'t worry, I\'m not taking any pictures or videos without your permission. Tiny Flashlight is just accessing the camera LED / flash.\n\n* CONTROL FLASH LIGHT\n - This is the old method of accessing the camera flashlight on Android 1.5 and 1.6.\n\n*** As you know, Tiny Flashlight is free, but also is one of the best supported apps on the Android Market. Currently, this is the only app that supports almost all devices with camera flashlight and fully supports all versions of Android (1.5, 1.6, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 4.0). This takes huge amounts of time and effort and in order for Tiny Flashlight to remain the best flashlight on the market, I have to use ads inside it.\n\nThe following permissions are required by Google\'s own ad provider (Admob) and Millennial Media (the biggest independent ad network). Both are respected industry leaders.\n\n* INTERNET\n - Used to load ad info from their servers. Nothing more.\n\n* READ PHONE STATE AND IDENTITY\n - Some Motorola devices have factory bugs. These devices don\'t have unique IDs and this became a problem for ad networks, because they can\'t function without it. There is a workaround for this problem by using the PHONE IDENTITY permission. This permission is used only for getting a unique id.\n\n\nKeywords:\nflashlight android, torch, strobe, brightest, linterna, \321\204\320\265\320\275\320\265\321\200\321\207\320\265, El feneri, best app, best flashlight, best tablet app, free phone app, tablet torch, free flashlight"

    description: "*Uninstall and reinstall can fix most issue*\n*Go to menu and send bug report to us if you have any issues*\nAdvanced Task Killer is also known as ATK. It is a tool to kill applications running. \n-Ignore List\n-One tap widget\n-Auto kill\n-Customize item height\n\nATK is often used to kill app and clean memory. We do suggest people use ATK manually kill apps instead of auto killing app.\n\n1. How to use it (for new users to quick start)?\n\nATK is pretty simple. Open this tool and take a look at the running applications list? Uncheck some apps you don\'t want to kill (such as Advanced Task Killer and some system apps) Tap the button \'Kill selected apps\', it will kill all applications checked.\n\n \n\n2. How to use it (for new users to do more)?\n\nIf you don\'t want to kill any app, you can tap it on the running applications list. Then it\'s checking box will turn to gray.\n\n \n\n3. Why there are app running that I haven\'t used or even opened?\n\nSome app will start up once you turn on your phone or be invoked by some events.\n\n \n\n4. What is ignore list/ignore?\n\nIgnore list is for you to ignore some app you don\'t want to kill. If you long press on the app listed on the main screen of ATK, the menu will pop up, then you can select \'Ignore\', the application would be moved to ignore list. When you tap \'Kill selected apps\', it won\'t be killed any more.\n\n \n\n5. What is default action for long press?\n\nYou can set your default action for long press and click on the settings. The system default action for long press is pop-menu. That means you when you long press on the application(displays on the running applications list), a pop-menu would shows up. For example, if you want to switch to the application after you long press on it, you can set the default action of long press to \'Switch to\'.\n\n \n\n6. Why I lost my network connection after I tap \'kill selected apps\'?\n\n This is because some apps related with network connection are killed. Such as \'voicemail\'. You can ignore it instead of killing it.\n\n \n\n7. Why my Home reloaded?\n\nThis is because some apps related with Home are killed. Such as \'HTC Sense\', \'Mail\'(if it is integrated with Home). You can ignore it instead of killing it.\n\n \n\n8. Why I cannot receive notification of Email?\n\nThis is because you killed \'Email\'. Instead of killing it, you need to ignore it.\n\n \n\n9. What is Auto Kill?\n\nIf you want to kill apps automatically you need to choose one of auto-kill level\n\n- Safe: Only kill the apps aren\'t running but still consume memory.\n\n- Aggressive: Kill the apps running background and apps aren\'t running.\n\n- Crazy: All apps except for apps you are using with.\n\nYou should be able to see Auto Kill information shows on the title, like \'Auto-Kill: 12:20\'. That means auto kill will start at 12:20, you can also change the frequency to impact the auto kill start time. \n\nApp killer is only a tool to kill apps and task. It won\'t help your battery directly. But if you kill any app which consume battery a lot, you might think app killer is helping your battery.\nAdvanced Task Killer Pro is paid version which doesn\'t contain ads.\nNote: For android 2.2 and later version, task manager cannot kill services and front apps, you have to force stop them. If you use task manager to kill them, services might restart, also notification won\'t be ereased from the top bar. So we don\'t suggest people use task manager kill them.\n\nKW: taskiller taskkiller task killer taskmanager manager panel taskpanel process app killer, task killer pro"

How to use it (for new users to do more)?\n\nIf you don\'t want to kill any app, you can tap it on the running applications list. Then it\'s checking box will turn to gray.\n\n \n\n3. Why there are app running that I haven\'t used or even opened?\n\nSome app will start up once you turn on your phone or be invoked by some events.\n\n \n\n4. What is ignore list/ignore?\n\nIgnore list is for you to ignore some app you don\'t want to kill. If you long press on the app listed on the main screen of ATK, the menu will pop up, then you can select \'Ignore\', the application would be moved to ignore list. When you tap \'Kill selected apps\', it won\'t be killed any more.\n\n \n\n5. What is default action for long press?\n\nYou can set your default action for long press and click on the settings. The system default action for long press is pop-menu. That means you when you long press on the application(displays on the running applications list), a pop-menu would shows up. For example, if you want to switch to the application after you long press on it, you can set the default action of long press to \'Switch to\'.\n\n \n\n6. Why I lost my network connection after I tap \'kill selected apps\'?\n\n This is because some apps related with network connection are killed. Such as \'voicemail\'. You can ignore it instead of killing it.\n\n \n\n7. Why my Home reloaded?\n\nThis is because some apps related with Home are killed. Such as \'HTC Sense\', \'Mail\'(if it is integrated with Home). You can ignore it instead of killing it.\n\n \n\n8. Why I cannot receive notification of Email?\n\nThis is because you killed \'Email\'. Instead of killing it, you need to ignore it.\n\n \n\n9. What is Auto Kill?\n\nIf you want to kill apps automatically you need to choose one of auto-kill level\n\n- Safe: Only kill the apps aren\'t running but still consume memory.\n\n- Aggressive: Kill the apps running background and apps aren\'t running.\n\n- Crazy: All apps except for apps you are using with.\n\nYou should be able to see Auto Kill information shows on the title, like \'Auto-Kill: 12:20\'. That means auto kill will start at 12:20, you can also change the frequency to impact the auto kill start time. \n\nApp killer is only a tool to kill apps and task. It won\'t help your battery directly. But if you kill any app which consume battery a lot, you might think app killer is helping your battery.\nAdvanced Task Killer Pro is paid version which doesn\'t contain ads.\nNote: For android 2.2 and later version, task manager cannot kill services and front apps, you have to force stop them. If you use task manager to kill them, services might restart, also notification won\'t be ereased from the top bar. So we don\'t suggest people use task manager kill them.\n\nKW: taskiller taskkiller task killer taskmanager manager panel taskpanel process app killer, task killer pro"

Once saved, you can edit, share, set a reminder, check off or delete the note through your device\'s menu button. When checking off a text note, the app places a slash through the list\'s title, a mark that shows on the main menu.\n\n- Making To do List or Shopping List -\nIn the checklist mode, you can add as many items as you\'d like and move their order around with the up and down buttons activated in the edit mode. After the list is finished and saved, you may check, and uncheck, each line on your list with a quick tap that generates a line slash. If all items have been checked, the list\'s title is slashed as well.\n\nWhen you\'re finished using the notepad, an automatic save command preserves your individual note.\n\nKeywords : Notebook, NotePad, Notes, Shopping List, Todo list, Todo, To do List, To do, 2do, To-do, Shopping, list maker, Calendar, Task, Memo, text editor, Sticky Note,  Post It, notes, notepad, memo pad, memo widget, sticky, editor, getting things done, GTD, supports colordict"

    description: "Listen to live audio from over 3,600 police and fire scanners, weather radios, and amateur radio repeaters from around the world (primarily in the United States and Australia, with more being added daily) on your phone.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* View scanners that are located nearest you, sorted by distance.\n* View the top 50 scanners that have the most listeners (list updated every 5 minutes).\n* View list of scanners added most recently (new additions are being added all the time).\n* Add scanners you listen to the most to your Favorites list for quick access.\n* Browse the directory of scanners by location or genre (public safety, air traffic, weather, railroad, etc).\n* Enable notifications to be notified when lots of people (such as over 1000, for example) are listening to any scanner (indicating that something big is happening).  You can also be notified when scanners located near you (or specific scanners of your choosing) have more than a certain number of listeners.\n* Add Scanner Radio widgets and shortcuts to your phone\'s home screen for quick access (app cannot be installed on SD card to access them).\n* Add a \"Scanner Radio Favorite\" shortcut to your home screen to launch a scanner feed via an alarm clock app or automation app.\n* Listen to RadioReference.com\'s audio archives to listen to audio that\'s been archived over the past 30 days.  Note: You *must* have an account on RadioReference.com and purchase their \"Premium Membership\" ($15 for 6 months) in order to access their archives using the app.\n\nThis is the free version of the app, below are the benefits of purchasing the Pro version (for only $2.99):\n\n* The Pro version contains no ads.\n* The play button at the top of the directory screens and on the widgets is can be used to start listening.\n* With the \"Scanner Radio Pro Locale PlgIn\" plug-in is also installed you can have Locale/Tasker launch the app and have one of your Favorites automatically begin playing based on one or more conditions or have the app stop playing.  One use for this feature is to have a scanner feed begin playing when your phone connects to a specific Bluetooth device and then have it stop when the connection to that Bluetooth device is no longer present.\n\nThe audio is provided by volunteers using real scanner radios.  If your area is not available, see the menu in the app for information on how to get it added.\n\nExplanation of why various permissions are needed:\n\nThe \"Phone Calls / Read Phone State\" permission is needed by the app so that it can detect when you\'re placing a phone call (or when one is being received) so that it can automatically stop the streaming of the audio to prevent it from interfering with the call.\n\nThe \"Fine (GPS) Location\" and \"Coarse Location\" permissions are required so that the app can determine what scanners are located in your area when you click on \"Near Me\".  When you click on \"Near Me\" the app first attempts to determine your location via the network, if that fails the app then tries to determine your location via GPS.\n\nThe \"Automatically Start at Boot\" permission is required so that a small portion of the app can be started when your phone boots if (and only if) you turn on the notifications feature of the app (that feature is turned off by default).\n\nIf the audio repeats or the app stays connected for only a short time, try returning to a directory screen in the app, then select \"Settings\" from the menu, then \"Player settings\", and then try changing the \"Streaming method\" setting.\n\nFollow \"Scanner Radio\" on Facebook or ScannerRadio on Twitter to be notified about tips, service interruptions, new beta versions, etc.\n\nKeywords: police scanner, radio scanner, air traffic"

Installed on my Samsung Galaxy S II Epic 4G Touch and not only works flawlessly, it does everything it said it would. I use Winamp and this app completely negates the need to \"go pro\". It also works for any other installed media player on my phone (MX, Pandora, etc). A \"MUST HAVE\" app for people who love to use their smart phone as their primary media playback device at home or on the go. This program ROCKS!!!\"\n\nAsitha *****\n\"Mega Bass\tOne of the greatest apps for Android\342\204\242. Cool. A++++++. 10/10\"\n\nLee *****\nA must have app makes music near perfection !!\n\nJudd *****\n\"Simply the best\tI\'ve tried every eq app available in the market and i\'d say this is the best. I\'m not even satisfied with all the players with built in 10 band eq. The only downside is after listening,with your music it\'ll automatically turn off. Other than that it\'s great!\"\n\n\nPlease feel free to send us your feedback.\n* Android is a trademark of Google Inc."

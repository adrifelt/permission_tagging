A strange woman answers.\nThe guy says, \"Who is this?\"\n\"This is the maid.\", answered the woman.\n\"We don\'t have a maid!\"\n\"I was just hired this morning by the lady of the house.\"\n\"Well, this is her husband. Is she there?\"\n\"Ummm .... she\'s upstairs in the bedroom with someone who I just figured was her husband.\"\nThe guy is fuming. He says to the maid, \"Listen, would you like to make $50,000?\"\n\"What do I have to do?\"\n\"I want you to get my gun from my desk in the den and shoot that witch and the jerk she is with.\" The maid puts down the phone. The guy hears footsteps, followed by two gunshots.\nThe maid comes back to the phone. \"What should I do with the bodies?\"\n\"Throw them in the swimming pool!\"\n\"What?! There\'s no pool here?\"\nLong pause... \"Uh .... is this 221-1811?\"\"\n\n\"This husband and wife are staying in a hotel, and after a romantic evening wining and dining they go off to bed. However, as soon as they settled down, the man (not quite ready for slumber) leans over and whispers softly, \"Hey snuggle boopy boops, your lickle hubby wubby isn\'t quite ready for bye-byes yet.\"\nThe wife takes the hint and says, \"OK, but I have to use the bathroom first.\" So off she goes but on her way back she trips over a piece of carpet and lands flat on her face.\nHer husband jumps up and exclaims in a concerned tone \"Oh my little honey bunny, is your nosey-wosey all right?\"\nNo harm is done, so she jumps into bed and they have mad passionate sex for three hours. Afterwards, the wife goes off to the bathroom again, but on her way she trips over the same piece of carpet and again lands flat on her face on the floor.\nHer husband looks over and grunts \"Clumsy b***h.\"\"\n\n\"A women on her deathbed called her husband and instructed him to look under their bed and open the wooden box he found. He was puzzled by the 3 eggs and $7,000 in cash he found in the box, so he asked his wife what the eggs were for.\n\"Oh those\", she replied, \"every time we had bad sex, I put an egg in the box\".\nNot bad, the husband thought to himself, after 35 years of marriage, then he asked, \"But what about the $7,000?\"\n\"Oh that\", she replied, \"every time I got a dozen I sold them.\"\"\n\n\"What are three words you dread the most while making love?\n\"Honey, I\'m home.\"\"\n\n\"How do you make four old ladies say \"F~**K!\"?\nGet a fifth one to yell \"BINGO!\"\"\n\nN.B.

This is why the latest chapters from MangaStream look like they\'re cut off.  As a result, MangaStream support will be removed in a future version.  It\'s still available in this version since older chapters still work.  Sorry for the inconvenience.\n\nThe free version of MangaWhat now has the same features of the paid version.  Enjoy."

Don\342\200\231t worry \342\200\224 you can still change comics by touching the edges.\n\nHave a special day in mind?

You never know what treasure awaits you (please be aware of probable drool).\n\nWanna post a strip for all your Facebook friends to see? First you need to login to Facebook. Then, simply post the selected comic strip on your Facebook wall along with a typically brilliant comment.\n\nWanna share a strip with your BFF? Email the selected comic and add a comment. You can also go to the Settings Page to activate your preference to put a copy of the comic strip into your Saved Photos folder on your Android when you email the strip.\n\nCan\342\200\231t get enough Garfield?

I walked to the curb backward, pointing my finger at the car and saying emphatically, \"Now you stay. Do you hear me? Stay! Stay! Stay!\"\nThis blonde bird gave me a strange look and said, \"Why don\'t you just put it in Park?\" \"\n\n\"Why did the blonde, throw breadcrumbs in the toilet bowl?\nTo feed the toilet duck. \"\n\n\"A blonde with two burnt ears goes to the doctor, who asks what has happened.\n\"The phone rang, and I accidentally picked up the iron.\"\n\"What about the other one?\"\n\"They called back.\"\"\n\n\"A blonde just texted me saying, \"What does idk stand for?\"\nI texted back saying, \"I don\'t know\" and she replied, \"OMG, no-one does!\"\"\n\n\"F*****g dating sites\nI asked for a fit blonde, who has a dirty mouth and likes it in the ring.\nI got paired with Hulk Hogan\""

    description: "Punch Your People lets you show no mercy to your friends (or relatives, or coworkers or college partners, etc.).\n\nYou just need a photo of your victim to get a three-dimensional version that you can punch or cut with a sharp knife (there will be more weapons in the future). The visual result is shocking. You will see how his skin gets bruised and bleedy wherever you hit. Eventually you\'ll get the skull exposed if you have much rage and mistreat him enough.\n\nAll your victims will be archived so you can comfortably assault them again. Plus, you can at any time of the action take a snapshot of the results to share with friends via social networks like Facebook, by e-mail, etc.\n\nHighlights:\n\342\230\205 An advanced booth application\n\342\230\205 Stunning 3D graphics\n\342\230\205 Realistic sound\n\342\230\205 Blood effects\n\342\230\205 Weapons: fist and knife (more to come)\n\342\230\205 Option to take snapshot to share (Facebook, e-mail...)\n\342\230\205 Victim archive\n\n\342\200\225\342\200\225\342\200\225\342\200\225\342\200\225\342\200\225\342\200\225\342\200\225\342\200\225\342\200\225\342\200\225\342\200\225\342\200\225\342\200\225\342\200\225\342\200\225\342\200\225\342\200\225\342\200\225\342\200\225\342\200\225\342\200\225\342\200\225\342\200\225\nKeep in touch through Facebook! http://facebook.com/Pedrocorpbook\nStay tuned on Twitter! https://twitter.com/Pedrocorp"

As a result, preschoolers kids learn the letters sounds much more faster.\n\nAn alphabet is a standard set of letters  which is used to write one or more languages based on the general principle that the letters represent phonemes of the spoken language. This is in contrast to other types of writing systems, such as logographies, in which each character represents a word, morpheme or semantic unit, and syllabaries, in which each character represents a syllable.\n\nA true alphabet has letters for the vowels of a language as well as the consonants. The first \"true alphabet\" in this sense is believed to be the Greek alphabet, which is a modified form of the Phoenician alphabet. In other types of alphabet either the vowels are not indicated at all, as was the case in the Phoenician alphabet, or else the vowels are shown by diacritics or modification of consonants, as in the devanagari used in India and Nepal.\n\nThe modern English alphabet is a Latin alphabet consisting of 26 letters \342\200\223 the same letters that are found in the basic Latin alphabet:\nMajuscule forms (also called uppercase or capital letters)\nA\tB\tC\tD\tE\tF\tG\tH\tI\tJ\tK\tL\tM\tN\tO\tP\tQ\tR\tS\tT\tU\tV\tW\tX\tY\tZ\n\nThe exact shape of printed letters varies depending on the typeface. The shape of handwritten letters can differ significantly from the standard printed form (and between individuals), especially when written in cursive style.\n\nWritten English uses a number of digraphs, such as ch, sh, th, wh, qu, etc., but they are not considered separate letters of the alphabet. Some traditions also use two ligatures, \303\246 and \305\223, or consider the ampersand (&) part of the alphabet.\n\nThe names of the letters are rarely spelled out, except when used in derivations or compound words, derived forms , pronunciation of certain acronyms , and in the names of objects named after letters .\n\nThe letters A, E, I, O, and U are considered vowel letters, since they represent vowels; the remaining letters are considered consonant letters, since when not silent they generally represent consonants. However, Y commonly represents vowels as well as a consonant, as very rarely does W. Conversely, U sometimes represents a consonant.\n\nThe letter most frequently used in English is E. The least frequently used letter is Z."

Teacher \"Johnny, that is not a word a ten year old should be using\"\nJohnny \"there are worse words than that miss, like murder and death\"\nTeacher \"No Johnny, the word you keep saying is much, much worse than murder and death\"\nJohnny \"I disagree miss, I bet you would rather be f****d than killed\"\"\n\n\"One night, Little Johnny went to sleep and dreamt his Uncle Bill died. He woke up and that evening, his dad got a call saying that Uncle Bill died. The next night, Little Johnny went to sleep and dreamt his Aunt Joy died. He woke up, and then that evening, his dad got a call saying that Aunt Joy died. He told his daddy, \"Two days ago, I had a dream Uncle Bill died, and then yesterday, I had a dream Aunt Joy died. His dad said, \"that\'s just a coincidence.\" The next morning he tells his dad, \"I had a dream that my dad died.\" His dad was terrified. He had the worst day at work and took every precaution. He didn\'t eat any of the food in case of food poisoning, and he drove slowly in case of a car wreck. When he finally got home, Little Johnny\'s mom asks him how his day at work was. \"Much more horrible than your day I\'m sure,\" his dad replied. \"I don\'t know,\" said his mom, \"The milkman dropped dead on the front porch today!\"\n\n\"One day there was this little boy named Johnny he had to go to the bathroom so he raised his hand and asked the teacher \"can I go to the bathroom.\" she said no.\n\nThen 5 mins later he raised his hand and said \"damit I have to piss can I go to the bathroom.\342\200\235 She said \"no not with that mouth.\342\200\235 She said now go to the corner and say your a.b.c.\'s frontwords and backwards\n\nHe went to the corner and said \"a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,q,r,s,t,u,v,w,x,y,z\"\n\nThen he said \"z,y,x,w,v,u,t,s,r,q,o,n,m,l,k,j,i,h,g,f,e,d,c,b,a\"\n\nThen she said \"Where is the p.\"\n\nLittle Johnny said \"Running down my leg.\"\"\n\n\"Little Johnny is passing his parents\' bedroom in the middle of the night, in search of a glass of water. Hearing a lot of moaning and thumping, he peeks in and catches his folks in The Act. Before dad can even react, Little Johnny exclaims \"Oh, boy! Horsy ride! Daddy, can I ride on your back?\"\n\nDaddy is relieved that Johnny\'s not asking more uncomfortable questions and seeing the opportunity not to break his stride, agrees.\n\nJohnny hops on and daddy starts going to town. Pretty soon mommy starts moaning and gasping.\n\nJohnny cries out \"HANG ON TIGHT DADDY! This is the part where me and the milkman usually get bucked off!\"\"\n\nN.B.

    description: "You can talk to your dog now! For free!\n\n\nThis app can translate the words you type on your keyboard to dog speech (by barking, whining and growling).\n\nIt usually takes a long time for your dog to understand. Just repeat a couple of days and you will see results.\n\n\n\n\342\230\205 How to use: \342\230\205\nAt first you have to find a quiet place (at home it is ideal, but without music around).\nType your phrase on main screen, put your cell phone near your pets ear and press Translate button. Then just wait until the phone plays the sound.\nMake sure your sentence is in English, without any numbers (it&apos;s really complicated to count in animal language) and it is maximum of thirty characters long (the more characters, the less chance of understanding). If your pet do not understand, try to translate the same sentence again (your animal needs to get used to the voice of this program), or raise up volume of your speaker.\n\nNo animals were injured during the development of this animal translator.\n\n\n\nIf you have any problem, so please contact us via e-mail.\n\nContact: peeta.bouzi@gmail.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/pages/Bouzisoft/302243606543198?ref=hl\n\nKeywords: Animal translator, talk to your pet dog, dog speech"

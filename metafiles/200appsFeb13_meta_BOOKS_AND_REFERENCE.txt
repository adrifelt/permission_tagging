    description: "English-Spanish and Spanish-English Dictionary\nDiccionario Ingl\303\251s-Espa\303\261ol y Espa\303\261ol-Ingl\303\251s\n\n* More than 85.900 words and expressions\n* Bookmark your favorite translations for fast reference\n* Works offline --> No internet connection needed, perfect for your trips or when no data connection is available\n* Listen to the correct pronunciation in British or American English and Spanish using Android\'s built-in Text-to-speech synthesizer.\n* Share translations by SMS, email, etc.\n* Optimized for Android ICS\n\nThis version is supported by ads. If you like the application, please consider upgrading to the ad-free version to support the development. Thanks :)\n\nFAQ:\n\nQ: How can I share a translation?\nA: Just press 2-3 seconds over the translation and you will be presented with a menu with all available sharing options based on the apps installed in your device (Email, SMS, Facebook, etc)\n\nQ: How can I change the speed of the voice?\nA: The speed of the speech is controlled by the TTS engine installed with Android. It can be set up by going to:\nSettings --> Voice input & output settings --> Text to speech settings --> speech rate\n\nQ: I don\'t like the voice. How can I improve it?\nA: The default text-to-speech engine installed with Android is Pico TTS, it\342\200\231s pretty simple and sometimes may sound a bit electronic. You can always install alternatives like eSpeak, SVox or IVONA from Google Play. Please check our blog post about this subject: http://www.movinapp.com/talking-android\n\nQ: How can I change the speech language?\nA: Just go to Menu --> Settings and select the language. Currently, 3 languages are available:\n  * English (US)\n  * English (GB)\n  * Spanish (Spain)\n\nDISCLAIMER:\nThe text-to-speech (TTS) technology may not be available in some devices. To check if your phone is able of speech synthesis: Menu -> Settings -> Voice input & output -> Text-to-speech settings.\nIf not installed, your device may ask you to install the TTS engine. An internet connection may be required. We recommend installing it before traveling as roaming data tariffs may be very expensive.\n\nTags: dictionary, Spanish, English, US, UK, GB, speech, offline, travel, search, diccionario, espa\303\261ol, espanol, ingles, voz, viajar, viajes, buscar"

    description: "This application is for all you constitution geeks. I wanted something that was easier to navigate than other applications I\'ve seen, had a real table of contents broken down by articles, sections and amendments, didn\'t treat the first ten amendments like one giant inseparable document, was searchable, and contained other related documents, ideas, and trivia like the Declaration of Independence, Gettysburg Address, The Virginia Plan, The Great Compromise, ratification dates, and anything else I could think of that floats in that new Constellation of Liberty the Framers were shooting for two centuries ago.\n\nPlease note that I did not write this, but gathered the text, notes, and annotations from a variety of sources, but mostly www.usconstitution.net \n(see below). I wanted a handy, self-contained reference to the Constitution.\n\nNavigation thru sections of the constitution or articles of confederation is done using the D-pad or track ball of your device if equipped, or by swiping your finger left or right across the screen. \n\nPressing the select text menu will temporarily disable gestures (finger swipes). The text selection process is is built into Android -- learn it and you have learned how to use it in this app. Once text is copied onto the clipboard, gestures will not be restored until you share the clipboard contents to email, or Twitter, whatever. Gestures are also restored by returning to the top level menu.\n\nFeatures:\n- Searchable US Constitution and Articles of Confederation\n- Resizable text\n- Ratification Dates of Amendments\n- Bios of the signers\n- Constitution timeline\n- Declaration of Independence\n- Articles of Confederation\n- Gettysburg address\n- Mayflower Compact\n- Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen\n- Star-Spangled Banner\n- Emancipation Proclamation\n- I Have a Dream\n\nMore!\n\n\nOdds & Ends:\n- The U.S. Constitution has not been updated since 1992. Any updates made to the app are to improve the functionality of the app, add features, or to remove bugs.\n\n- The app contains a few hyperlinks to some source or reference material on the web, so it will ask for internet access in the permission when you install.\n\n- If you find a bug (and you want it fixed) email the developer using the link on this page, don\'t just leave a comment (Android secret: Developers do not read their comments).\n\nEnjoy!!\n\nKen"

    description: "Chord! is a guitar chord finder. Unlike most of the other apps, it generates itself chords diagrams, so it supports any chord (even slash ones like D/F#) in any tuning, with any number of strings (guitar, banjo, ukulele, bass, mandolin, etc.).\n\nThis is the free version with fully functional chord search, but only four scales instead of four hundred and five tunings, no reverse chord and scale search, no colors, no custom tunings database.\n\nYou can hear how each diagram sounds by sweeping your finger across the strings.\n\nIn the full version, you can also reverse search chords:  Entering on a neck the fingering will give you instantaneously the possible names of the chord and you will then be able to explore possible variations.\n\nThe full version embeds a database with a hundred of tunings for various instruments and you can add you own ones. In this free version, there are only 5 tunings, for standard guitar, bass, banjo (4 str.) and ukulele. The full version of this database contains also four hundred scales that can be displayed or reverse searched in any tuning. In this free version, there are only four scales.\n\nThe app fully supports left handed instruments.\n\nNote: Some Archos devices may no be able to reproduce sound.\n\nFull changelog in the app."

    description: "PREFACE \nI\'d never given much thought to how I would die \342\200\224 though I\'d had reason \nenough in the last few months \342\200\224 but even if I had, I would not have \nimagined it like this. \nI stared without breathing across the long room, into the dark eyes of \nthe hunter, and he looked pleasantly back at me. \nSurely it was a good way to die, in the place of someone else, someone I \nloved. Noble, even. That ought to count for something. \nI knew that if I\'d never gone to Forks, I wouldn\'t be facing death now. \nBut, terrified as I was, I couldn\'t bring myself to regret the decision. \nWhen life offers you a dream so far beyond any of your expectations, it\'s \nnot reasonable to grieve when it comes to an end. \nThe hunter smiled in a friendly way as he sauntered forward to kill me."

Instead, KnowledgeBook: Cooking contains all the little bits of information and rules of thumb that you need to really use and understand your recipes -- what can be substituted for buttermilk or baking soda in a pinch, how many bananas it takes to make 1 cup of slices, how many cups are in a pint, what temperature an oven should be set to if the recipe calls for a \"moderately hot\" oven, etc. \n\nKnowledgeBook: Cooking compiles all this information in one place, and adds much more: what can be substituted for buttermilk if you don\'t have vinegar? How many US cups are in an Imperial pint? (or an Australian pint?) What does it mean to papillote something? How should a slow cooker recipe be adjusted at high altitude? What temperature in Fahrenheit does Gas Mark 6 on a British stove correspond to? \n\nWith sections for Yields and Equivalents (including canning yields), Substitutions, general cooking terms, Measurement conversions, and High-Altitude considerations, KnowledgeBook: Cooking aims to be a one-stop reference for all the \"extra\" information needed to help you understand your recipes and get to Cooking!\n\nWhat people are saying about KnowledgeBook: Cooking:\n\n\"As a caterer, I have found this app to be very valuable...I love the yields for produce. It\'s great to know how much of a fairly expensive item I will need to make a recipe. This cuts down on waste a great deal and saves me money.\"\n(\"Phoenix 1972\", Feb. 2011)\n\n\"I have installed a similar app but this one is much better. It\'s really useful in cooking.\"\n(\"Asparago\",  Jan 2011)\n\n\"Excellent app very handy for alternative ingredients and very informative :) must have app\"\n(\"Cheeksnes\",  Jan 2011)\n\n\"Awesome app!  The best cooking reference app I\'ve ever used all wrapped up in a beautiful FREE bow!  It\'s actually better than most of the paid cooking reference apps and those don\'t offer HALF the info this one does.  A must have for anyone who cooks!\"\n(\"Tatem214\", Dec 2010)"

Experience them.\n\nBlio doesn\'t just put pages on a screen, it offers new possibilities.\nIn Blio\na textbook becomes a classroom\342\200\246\na cookbook becomes a kitchen\342\200\246\nand a fairytale, a place where dreams really do come true.\nBecause Blio is so much more than words.\nWe are an experience.\n\nBringing books to life is about more than just recreating the words on the page. That\342\200\231s why we developed Blio.\n\nBlio is smart enough to know that books are more than just words: there\342\200\231s style, presentation, and a world of color. And smart enough to know all of that enhances your reading experience.  That\342\200\231s what you love about books. So books in Blio have the same layout, fonts, and full-color images that you enjoy in the print version of your favorite titles.  Finally there\342\200\231s an eBook reader that brings not only novels to life, but cookbooks, travel guides, how-to manuals, textbooks, and children\342\200\231s books to life in vibrant color.  \n\nBut eBooks should do more: they should leverage everything that the device you\342\200\231re reading on is capable of. Blio does just that, with many books having read aloud by a text-to-speech voice (purchase required) or by an audiobook track, with words highlighted as they are spoken. You can look up words you might not be familiar with or get more information on a topic by searching Google, Wikipedia, and more without ever leaving your book. And Blio has a virtual library that you can view from anywhere, so you can access and read your books on any of your devices. \n\nTry a whole new eBook experience with Blio,  where books are more than words.\n        \nTop Features:\n        \n\342\200\242  Get 4 free books per year exclusive for T-Mobile customers!

This  allows the user to change between a black background for night time reading, and a more traditional white background for daytime reading.\n\nIt also allows you to chose the amount of verses on display, and change the font size of the Bible text. \n\nAlternatively \"KJV Bible - Red Text\" has the words of Jesus in red. KJV Bible - Red Text is also available from the Android Market.\n\nPlease enjoy :)"

See details from either the 2012 Emergency Response Guidebook (ERG 2012) or the 2008 Emergency Response Guidebook (ERG 2008)\n\nPowerful search capabilities will help you quickly find information by matching just part of the UN/NA number or material name. Cargo Decoder also supports Voice Search to make searches even faster.\n\nProtective distance information,toxic inhalation hazards, and ERG2012 reference pages are just a touch away for emergency responders and HazMat personnel.  A simple swipe quickly moves you to the information you need.\n\nCargo Decoder is my way to give back to the first responders who are always there for us.  Cargo Decoder for Android will always be free and will never contain ads.  Cargo Decoder uses no network bandwidth so information will always be available even if the cell network is not.\n\nCargo Decoder runs on just about every device running Android version 1.5 and later.\n\nCargo Decoder now supports sharing of material details.  Select a material and touch the Share icon. Create a notebook of materials found using Evernote (Evernote can add GPS information too). Share information to others via email or text messaging. Configure the information about the material you want to share in Settings.  Important: Sharing with Facebook does not work even though Facebook adds itself to the sharing list.  Facebook says the behavior is \"by design\"(https://developers.facebook.com/bugs/332619626816423)\n\nIf you like Cargo Decoder, please consider supporting it by purchasing the Cargo Decoder Plus Module.  Installing the Cargo Decoder Plus Module unlocks special features added to say \342\200\234Thank you!\342\200\235 to our supporters.  Your support will also help us bring you the 2012 Emergency Response Guidebook in Spanish and French when it is released.\n\nCargo Decoder Plus features include:\n* A unique view of all materials that correspond to a Guide page.  This view will be useful if you see a placard or Guide number and want to know what material it might be.\n* Access to both ERG2012 and ERG2008 reference pages.\n\nUsers who are not yet supporters can also use Plus features but will be periodically asked to consider become a Cargo Decoder supporter."

    description: "Bible-Discovery for Android is a feature rich off-line Bible Study Tool, was designed for those who are not satisfied with the skimming of the Bible and they need more. Who would like to understand the Bible verses and their original messages.\n\nThe genuine treasures in the Bible are unavailable on the surface, you should dig deep to bring them up.\n\nThe Android Bible program is freeware. And you can purchase an enlarged version that is suitable for studying the Bible.\n\nThe Android Bible program does the following:\n\n- Any audio Bible can be integrated into the program, if every mp3 file contains exactly one chapter of the Bible. More than 600 audio Bibles can be integrated from the www.faithcomesbyhearing.com, and more than 10 from www.audiotreasure.com. \n- The text can be scrolled automatically. Scrolling can be speeded up and slowed down. It needs a double click to start scrolling.\n- Local menu is presented by a long-click: with its help among others the clicked word or the Strong-number can be searched for or the dictionary can be scrolled.\n- Bookmarks can be handled. The bookmarks in different categories make possible that the verses should be colored differently.\n- Commentary can be written next to the verses.\n- Notes can be written.\n- You can read the Bible, search results, bookmarks, dictionary and commentary entries, and your own notes with the built-in speech generator (as an Audio Bible)\n- Verses can be seen with a black background in night-mode.\n- After the activation of the bubble-prompt, the word\'s dictionary-meaning and its original shades of meaning can be looked up.\n- The Bible translations can be changed.\n- Books, chapters and verses can be selected very easily.\n- It can be easy to scroll to the next chapter.\n- Display of Strong-numbers can be switched.\n- Cross-references, morphology and transliteration of Greek and Hebrew words can be displayed.\n- It can be navigated through the search results not only in the search panel but also in the Bible panel.\n- Simple and compound expressions can also be searched for by using even brackets or wildcards. It possesses just as highly developed searching possibilities as the PC Bible-Discovery program does.\n- Dictionary is not only suitable for scrolling but also for searching.\n- Type-size can be enlarged or reduced.\n- Holding the most of the push-buttons pressed long, the function of the button is written textually. Some of the push-buttons also have long-click function.\n- Quick bookmarking feature.\n\n\nEnglish Bible translations: ACV, ASV, BBE, BWE, Darby, Etheridge, Geneva1599, Godbey, HNV, JPS, KJV: King James Version with Strongs Numbers and Morphology, Montgomery, RKJNT, RNKJV, Rotherham, RWebster, Tyndale, Twenty, UKJV: Updated King James Version, WEB, Webster, Weymouth, Worsley, YLT\n\nYou can download more than 90 Bible translations (KJV, Spanish Reina-Valera Biblia, magyar K\303\241roli Biblia)\n\nCommentaries: Barnes, Clarke, MHC, MHCC, Scofield, TSK, Wesley, DTN, DutKant, Geneva, JFB, Lightfoot, MAK, Rieger, TFG, Vincent\'s VWS. \n\nDictionaries: BDB: Brown-Driver-Briggs Hebrew Lexicon, Thayer: Thayer\'s Greek Lexicon, Strong\'s Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible, Greek to Hebrew, Hebrew to Greek, Easton, Hitchcock, ISBE, KJVD, Morrish, Nave, Packard, Robinson, SAOA, Smith, TCR, Torrey, Vine\n\nE-Books: Pilgrim, Finney, Josephus, Westminster, Jewish History Maps, Smith Bible Atlas, American Bible Society Maps, The Complete Sunday School Atlas\n\nOther languages: Arabic, Chamorro, Cherokee, Czech, Danish, German, Greek, Esperanto, Spanish, Estonian, Basque, Finnish, French, Gothic, Hebrew, Croatian, Haitian, Hungarian, Icelandic, Italian, Korean, Latin, Malagasy, Burmese, Dutch, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Scots, Albanian, Syriac, Swedish, Swahili, Tagalog (Filipino), Ukrainian, Vietnamese, Xhosa, Chinese\n\n\nHungarian name of the program is \"Biblia-Felfedez\305\221\"\n\nUser interface languages: English, German, French, Hungarian, Korean, Romanian, Russian, Spanish"

    description: "In music, a song is a composition for voice or voices, performed by singing. A choral or vocal song may be accompanied by musical instruments, or it may be unaccompanied, as in the case of a cappella songs. The lyrics (words) of songs are typically of a poetic, rhyming nature, though they may be religious verses or free prose.\n\nA song may be for a solo singer, a duet, trio, or larger ensemble involving more voices. Songs with more than one voice to a part are considered choral works. Songs can be broadly divided into many different forms, depending on the criteria used. One division is between \"art songs\", \"pop songs\", and \"folk songs\". Other common methods of classification are by purpose (sacred vs secular), by style (dance, ballad, Lied, etc.), or by time of origin (Renaissance, Contemporary, etc.).\n\nA song is a piece of music for accompanied or unaccompanied voice or voices or, \"the act or art of singing,\" but the term is generally not used for large vocal forms including opera and oratorio. However, the term is, \"often found in various figurative and transferred sense (e.g. for the lyrical second subject of a sonata...).\" The noun \"song\" has the same etymological root as the verb \"to sing\" and the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) defines the word to mean \"that which is sung\" or \"a musical composition suggestive of song.\" The OED also defines the word to mean \"a poem\" or \"the musical phrases uttered by some birds, whales, and insects, typically forming a recognizable and repeated sequence and used chiefly for territorial defence or for attracting mates.\""

    description: "Holy Bible Verses let\'s you read and learn the Bible in an easy and fun way. Teach yourself and teach others, spread the good word of GOD and JESUS CHRIST.\n\nWe currently support 2 of the most popular bible versions, \"King James Version\" (KJV) for English language and \"La Biblia de las Am\303\251ricas\" (LBLA) for Spanish language. More translations and versions coming in future updates.\n\nUse swipe gestures to navigate. Swipe down to get a random one. Share verses with friends and family by long tapping the screen and hear them being spoken out loud by tapping on the \"speak(lips)\" icon in the title bar (internet connection recommended, but works with internal text-to-speech as well). You can also mannage your bookmarks and search trough the entire bible.\n\nUse the titlebar for fast navigation. Press on the \"home\" icon to get to the main screen; press on the title to quickly get to the book list or available versions; use the \"bookmark\" icon to add or remove a verse from Bookmarks, the \"speak(lips)\" icon for text-to-speech, the \"search\" icon to search trough the entire Bible, or the \"share\" icon in the main screen to tell others about this app.\n\nFeatures:\n- KJV and LBLA Bible versions;\n- animated gestures;\n- great looking UI;\n- only one verse at a time is shown on screen so you can better focus you attention and understand it\'s true meaning;\n- swipe gestures to navigate trough verses; \n- spread the word by sharing verses when long tapping the screen; \n- interactive titlebar that shows your location, total number of verses in a book (and the current verse) and helps navigation;\n- complex search functionality to help you find what you need trough all books and chapters;\n- manage bookmarks list;\n- high quality text-to-speech;\n- set your preferences.\n\nUse the HOLY BIBLE VERSES APP in Church or with family and friends:\n- quicly go to the verses being read in church and follow along;\n- learn the bible, show it to your friends and family, spread the good word;\n- have fun by seeing which verse faith throws at you by using the \"Touch of Grace\" option in the main screen;\n- go to a random chapter of the ible and start reading from there;\n- curious about statistics? see how many times the name of our saviour, JESUS CHRIST apperas in the bible by searching for it and seeing the number of results;\n- the easy interaction that our app provides will make going trough the Bible a fun and personal experience for everyone.\n\n*** TEXT-TO-SPEECH ***\n* There are phones that do not support text-to-speech. Sorry for that.\n* To check whether your phone has text-to-speech capabilities go to Menu -> Settings -> Voice input & output -> Text-to-speech settings. On models with Android 1.6 go to Menu -> Settings -> Speech synthesis.\n* Also you can reach text-to-speech settings by clicking the \"TTS Settings\" menu item of our application.\n* If Pico TTS engine is not installed, please install it by clicking \"Install voice data\".\n* To select the default speech engine, speech rate, or to specify your default settings, go to Text-to-speech settings as described above.\n\nPlease use the \"Report\" option in the menu to send us feedback.\n\nThe internet permissions are needed for text-to-speech and the phone state permission is needed for ads. The app is free but we need ad support to carry on, maintain it, and improve it. We appreciate your understanding and support and thank you for giving our app a try!"

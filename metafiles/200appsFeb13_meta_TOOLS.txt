    description: "Flashlight app for your device! Incredibly simple and yet very useful flashlight application. Will use your device\'s camera LED / flash / screen as a torch.\n\nTiny Flashlight is currently the best led flashlight app on the Android Market, because:\n\n - It supports the widest range of devices with camera flashlight (led flash)\n - It\'s also the brightest flashlight / torch, because of the camera flashlight, which emits very intense light in the dark. \n - Has different widgets to choose from\n - Has great and diverse screen lights\n - Has the best flashlight support\n - The best tablet app\n - Free of Charge\n\nLight sources:\n==============\n\n * Camera LED flashlight - Uses your phone\'s camera flashlight to emit bright light. Note that some devices don\'t have a camera flashlight. In this case the led flashlight option will be disabled, but you can still use one of the screen lights.\n\n * Screen Light - This is the basic white screen flashlight, which is bright enough for daily use. You can use it as your primary flashlight option in case your device doesn\'t have a camera flashlight or you want to save the battery.\n\n * Warning Lights, Police Lights, Color Flashlight, Strobe Flashlight, Morse Code, Text to Morse, Manual Morse Code, Camera Light - Different light sources, which may be useful in many situations. You can change the brightness and the colors.\n\nThe Best Free Flashlight app when you need reliability, functionality, and lights diversity\n\nCAUTION: Strobe lighting can trigger seizures in photosensitive epilepsy!\n\nFlashlight Widget and Lock Screen widgets:\n========\nTiny Flashlight is one of the few applications on the android market, which is free and has different widgets to choose from when the device has an option for a led flashlight. Also, Tiny Flashlight supports the newly added lockscreen widgets in Android 4.2 and later.\n\nFlashlight Permissions:\n============\nWhy Tiny Flashlight needs so many permissions and how are they used:\n\n* TAKE PICTURES AND VIDEOS (CAMERA flashlight)\n - In order to start the camera flashlight on some devices, Tiny Flashlight has to use a small part of the camera hardware and it needs this permission. Don\'t worry, I\'m not taking any pictures or videos without your permission. Tiny Flashlight is just accessing the camera LED / flash.\n\n* CONTROL FLASH LIGHT\n - This is the old method of accessing the camera flashlight on Android 1.5 and 1.6.\n\n*** As you know, Tiny Flashlight is free, but also is one of the best supported apps on the Android Market. Currently, this is the only app that supports almost all devices with camera flashlight and fully supports all versions of Android (1.5, 1.6, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 4.0). This takes huge amounts of time and effort and in order for Tiny Flashlight to remain the best flashlight on the market, I have to use ads inside it.\n\nThe following permissions are required by Google\'s own ad provider (Admob) and Millennial Media (the biggest independent ad network). Both are respected industry leaders.\n\n* INTERNET\n - Used to load ad info from their servers. Nothing more.\n\n* READ PHONE STATE AND IDENTITY\n - Some Motorola devices have factory bugs. These devices don\'t have unique IDs and this became a problem for ad networks, because they can\'t function without it. There is a workaround for this problem by using the PHONE IDENTITY permission. This permission is used only for getting a unique id.\n\n\nKeywords:\nflashlight android, torch, strobe, brightest, linterna, \321\204\320\265\320\275\320\265\321\200\321\207\320\265, El feneri, best app, best flashlight, best tablet app, free phone app, tablet torch, free flashlight"

    description: "InkPad Notepad is the simple, elegant, easy way to keep notes on your phone, or on the web.\n\nOnce upon a time, you had to write down notes in a paper notepad and carry it around with you. If you wrote a shopping list or to do list, you might go to the store and discover you had forgotten your notepad. But how often do you forget to bring your mobile phone with you? Introducing InkPad, the notepad you\342\200\231ll only forget as often as your phone!\n\nInkpad Notepad let\'s you access your notes online at www.InkpadNotepad.com. You can create or edit notes from the convenience of your computer\'s web browser, and always have access to your notes from your phone when you\'re offline too.\n\nCREATE NOTES\nInkPad is designed to look like a paper notepad, and is just as simple to use. When you open InkPad, you\342\200\231ll see a list of all notes you\342\200\231ve created. To add a new note, tap on the \342\200\234+\342\200\235 button at the bottom of the screen. The first line of text will automatically be used as the title.\n\nCREATE TO DO LIST\nCreate a note as usual, then select the \"to do list\" button at the top of the note screen.\n\nCREATE SHOPPING LIST\nCreate a note as usual, then select the \"shopping list\" button at the top of the note.\n\nEDIT NOTE OR TO DO LIST\nNow you can write your note. Just like a paper notepad, you don\342\200\231t have to do anything special to save your notes, they are auto-saved for you.\n\nSAVE\nAs mentioned above, notes are auto-saved. You don\342\200\231t have to do anything special to save them.\n\nBACKUP NOTES TO SD CARD\nBy default, notes are backed up to SD card as text files. You can turn this feature off in Notepad Settings.\n\nSYNC NOTES ONLINE\nWith version 2.0, Inkpad Notepad now lets you sync/backup notes online. You can access your online notes at www.InkpadNotepad.com by signing in with the same Google account you selected in the mobile app.\n\nSEARCH YOUR NOTES OR TO DO LISTS\nInkpad Notepad now gives you an option to search your notes or to do lists. From the home screen, tap on the search icon, then begin writing. As you write, the list of notes will be filtered to only display notes containing the search keyword. Press the \"X\" button to close note search, and view all notes as usual.\n\nSHARE NOTES\nAt the bottom of each note is a \342\200\234share\342\200\235 button. Tapping it brings up all the ways to share. Typical ways include email, SMS, etc. \n\nCHANGE NOTE\342\200\231S TITLE\nTo change a notes title, tap on the title area at the top of that note.\n\nDELETE NOTE\nIf you don\342\200\231t want a note any longer, you can delete it in several ways: 1) Open the note, tap the \342\200\234delete\342\200\235 button at the bottom of the page. 2) From the main notes screen, long-press the title of a note, then tap on \342\200\234delete\342\200\235.\n\nREMOVE ADS\nThe free version of InkPad Notepad is ad supported. If you would like to remove the ads and support the continued development of InkPad Notepad, you can do so. From the main screen, press your phone\342\200\231s menu button, then tap the \342\200\234remove ads\342\200\235 button.\n\nBACKUP NOTES\nTo backup a note,  press the share button and email to yourself the note you want to backup.\n\nTYPICAL USES\nWrite To do lists (Note: check-list support is now here for to do lists!), shopping lists, addresses, email, SMS, Twitter updates*, write lyrics, poems, or even a novel if you feel like it! The uses are limited only by your imagination.\n\nFollow @workpail on twitter (http://twitter.com/workpail) and facebook (http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100001471431772) to receive updates about InkPad Note pad.\n\nKnown issues: some users have experienced problems when using Swype keyboard, please email me if you have problems. Atrix users with previously installed version of the note pad will have to change the font to \"Android default font\".\n\n*Assumes separate Twitter client is installed, Twitter cannot post note pad content longer than 140 characters."

Thank you.\n\nFAQ:\n* If you want data size conversions in multiples of 1024, use kibibytes, mebibytes, gibibytes, etc - see en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibibyte.\n\n* If the percent key appears to give wrong answers, make sure you are pressing \'=\' at the end, e.g. \'25 + 10 % =\' will give 27.5.\n\n* If sin/cos/tan functions don\'t give the answer you are expecting, make sure you are in the correct angle mode. Degrees, radians and grads are supported, indicated by DEG, RAD, GRAD in the display. Use the DRG key to change mode.\n\n* If any of the digit keys are disabled, or the decimal point doesn\'t work, or you have answers with letters in, or basic arithmetic appears to be wrong, then you are in binary, octal or hexadecimal mode. Press DEC to return to decimal operation. If you don\'t need these modes, please make sure that \'Enable Radix Modes\' is disabled in the settings.\n\n* If you can\'t find HEX, BIN or OCT modes, go to the settings and make sure that \'Enable Radix Modes\' is checked.\n\nPlease read the help for more information."

    description: "Now you can take a snapshot easily on your Android device (no root required, but possible connect device to computer and run app). Take screenshots on your tablet, phone or other Android device for FREE!\n\nShare, draw, add text to a screenshot or even send/edit multiple screenshots!\n\n**If you can\342\200\231t get the app to work please email us and don\342\200\231t post it in the reviews since we can\342\200\231t respond to reviews. Thanks.**\n\nWhy is Screenshot Ultimate the perfect screen capture app? Well, it has the most features and we support over 10 different capture methods. So if this app can\342\200\231t take a screenshot no other screenshot app will!\n\nWe support rooted and non-rooted devices; however, if you have a non-rooted phone you might have to run a small app on your computer to enable screen shooting functionality. Read the FAQ for more information.\n\n**\nThis app is free and will stay free. However, if you want more features, see no more ads (or popups) inside Screenshot Ultimate and support development you should have a look at \342\200\234Screenshot Ultimate Pro\342\200\235. Thanks!\n**\n\nTrigger methods:\n- Overlay icon which is visible on top of all screens (icon, button or custom icon)\n- Shake\n- Service icon click\n- Audio\n- Power connect/disconnect\n- Folder listener\n- Webserver\n- Camera hardware button\n- Long click search hardware button\n- Custom shortcut\n- Widget button\n- Button inside the app\n\nFor every trigger separately you can set: what to do after, vibrate, sound, toast, timeout, countdown, more!\n\nFeatures:\n- Free!\n- Edit taken screenshot: draw, add text, crop, add information (android version, date/time, etc), rotate, mirror, switch colors, overlay an image, use your own editor\n- Share taken screenshot: Use your custom app for sharing (Email, Picasa, etc), or upload to Imgur, POST to server\n- View all taken screenshots and select multiple for sending, create zip, edit and more!\n- Automatically apply \"Screenshot Adjustments\" to every taken screenshot (switch colors, rotate, mirror, add text, crop, overlay image)\n- Multiple capture methods (over 10) with an auto detect option so you can select the best option\n- Set default save folder and filename\n- Set image format\n- Set optional custom shutter sound\n- Trigger media scan\n- View / Send log\n- More!\n\nFAQ\nWhat can I do with the \342\200\234Folder listener\342\200\235 trigger?\nIf your device has built-in screenshot capability you can set the app to listen for changes to a folder. As soon as an image is created in that folder Screenshot Ultimate will also trigger (for editing, saving to your own folder, etc). You could also use another screenshot app, like Screenshot UX or Screenshot It, and use Screenshot Ultimate to handle the editing / saving.\n\nNo \342\200\234Capture Method\342\200\235 is available for my device!\nThis is normal if your device isn\'t rooted. It\'s the way how the Android security model works; it just doesn\'t allow taking a screenshot on some devices. However, you can enable screenshot functionality on your device by enabling it through a computer. To see how you can do this go to \342\200\234Screenshot Ultimate\342\200\235 > \342\200\234Settings\342\200\235 > \342\200\234Capture methods\342\200\235 > \342\200\234No root help\342\200\235. You can email the manual to yourself so you can complete it on your computer (Windows, Linux or OSX).\n\nHow to...\nJust contact us by email and we\342\200\231ll try to help you. Just remember, if you post it in the review we can\342\200\231t respond and help you, so please contact us by email.\n\nVisit us on: http://www.icecoldapps.com/\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/IceColdApps\nLike us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/IceColdApps\n\nWhat are the permissions for?\n- INTERNET: the ads and uploading to Imgur\n- RECORD_AUDIO: for the audio trigger (blow in the microphone to take a screenshot) \n- SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW: for the overlay icon (click it to take a screenshot)\n- RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED: for the option to auto start the app on boot\n- WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE: save the screenshots\n- VIBRATE: to alert you when a screenshot was taken\n- WAKE_LOCK: optionally set your device to stay awake when the screenshot app is running"

    description: "After long time research, world\'s first android cleaning method was released, exclusive in Clean Master.\n(The multi-language project of Clean Master is on the way, anyone willing help for translation or revision please email \"logan#ksmobile.com\", Thanks)\n\nWhat is Clean Master?\nClean Master is a Must Have cleaner app for android users. It provides comprehensive cleaning methods to clean cache, residual files, app packages and erase history on android phones. It also kills running tasks and releases RAM to boost your phone and save battery life.\n\nWhy choose Clean Master?\nClean Master is easy and effective. After a comprehensive cleaning, MBs even GBs space will be released for your phone. No superuser permission required.\nWhat can Clean Master do?\n\n[History Eraser]\n***New algorithm released to detect and clean popular apps cache. ***\n\nAre you chatting with whatsapp? \nAre you listening to music with spotify?\nAre you aware of that your android device might have hundreds of cache images, audio and videos generated by these apps?\n\nNow with the new innovative cleaning method exclusive in Clean Master v2.1, you can get rid of the files generated by those popular apps easily and automatically.\n\nCurrently supported apps:\nWhatsapp\nSpotify\nPinterest\nLine\nWechat\nMore...\n\n*********************************************************************\n\nOn Android devices, history include privacy history and application cache files. Privacy are privacy data of web browser, IM, Ebay and Paypal, etc. If you don\'t want others to know what you were doing, and steal your account and password, Clean Master has got history eraser function to help protect your privacy. Application Cache Files are the temporary files created by applications. For example, while you\'re using browser, it saves the images as cache files. It\'s the same for other application and all you need is a rated cache cleaner. Using Clean Master to clear cache files regularly will save phone space and speed up application performance.\n\n[Residual Files]\nAfter installing an app from market, it\'s sometimes required to download extra data. However, when you uninstall that app, the data is still there, which makes your available space smaller and smaller. For example, almost all the games from Gameloft require a huge extra data, from 200M to 1GB. But the data would be there even the game is uninstalled. Clean Master will save GBs for your phone, after cleaning these residual files.\n\n[Task Killer]\nThe tasks running on background not only occupy system RAM, but also waste your battery life. The Task Killer of Clean Master can kill the unwanted tasks and release more RAM to speed up your android device. An excellent shortcut (1Tap Booster) is also provided to make the work cannot be easier. Root permission is not necessary, but if Task Killer granted root permission, it will perform better.\n\n[Temp APKs]\nApp Packages are the .apk files used to install apps. When you download and install apps from markets, updating them on phone, the apk files are becoming more and more, eating the huge space of your phone. However, you should no longer worry about this issue, because Clean Master can find all the temp apk files on your phone, and clean them for you by an easy tap.\n\nPS: The important system tasks have been whitelisted already, if you notice any problems while using Task Killer, please contact us.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ksmobilenet\n\nKey Features:\nHistory Eraser\nClean cache Files\nClean unused files\nManage and clean app packages\nRemind unused files when app installed\nKill running tasks/release RAM\n\nKW: cache, clean, android, phone, unused, gameloft, apk, privacy, history, cleaner, booster, 1tap boost, task killer, eraser"

    promoText: "After long time research, world\'s first android cleaning method was released, exclusive in Clean Master.\n(The multi-language project of Clean Master is on the way, anyone willing help for translation or revision please email \"logan#ksmobile.com\", Thanks)\n\nWhat is Clean Master?\nClean Master is a Must Have cleaner app for android users. It provides comprehensive cleaning methods to clean cache, residual files, app packages and erase history on android phones. It also kills running tasks and releases RAM to boost your phone and save battery life.\n\nWhy choose Clean Master?\nClean Master is easy and effective. After a comprehensive cleaning, MBs even GBs space will be released for your phone. No superuser permission required.\nWhat can Clean Master do?\n\n[History Eraser]\n***New algorithm released to detect and clean popular apps cache. ***\n\nAre you chatting with whatsapp? \nAre you listening to music with spotify?\nAre you aware of that your android device might have hundreds of cache images, audio and videos generated by these apps?\n\nNow with the new innovative cleaning method exclusive in Clean Master v2.1, you can get rid of the files generated by those popular apps easily and automatically.\n\nCurrently supported apps:\nWhatsapp\nSpotify\nPinterest\nLine\nWechat\nMore...\n\n*********************************************************************\n\nOn Android devices, history include privacy history and application cache files. Privacy are privacy data of web browser, IM, Ebay and Paypal, etc. If you don\'t want others to know what you were doing, and steal your account and password, Clean Master has got history eraser function to help protect your privacy. Application Cache Files are the temporary files created by applications. For example, while you\'re using browser, it saves the images as cache files. It\'s the same for other application and all you need is a rated cache cleaner. Using Clean Master to clear cache files regularly will save phone space and speed up application performance.\n\n[Residual Files]\nAfter installing an app from market, it\'s sometimes required to download extra data. However, when you uninstall that app, the data is still there, which makes your available space smaller and smaller. For example, almost all the games from Gameloft require a huge extra data, from 200M to 1GB. But the data would be there even the game is uninstalled. Clean Master will save GBs for your phone, after cleaning these residual files.\n\n[Task Killer]\nThe tasks running on background not only occupy system RAM, but also waste your battery life. The Task Killer of Clean Master can kill the unwanted tasks and release more RAM to speed up your android device. An excellent shortcut (1Tap Booster) is also provided to make the work cannot be easier. Root permission is not necessary, but if Task Killer granted root permission, it will perform better.\n\n[Temp APKs]\nApp Packages are the .apk files used to install apps. When you download and install apps from markets, updating them on phone, the apk files are becoming more and more, eating the huge space of your phone. However, you should no longer worry about this issue, because Clean Master can find all the temp apk files on your phone, and clean them for you by an easy tap.\n\nPS: The important system tasks have been whitelisted already, if you notice any problems while using Task Killer, please contact us.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ksmobilenet\n\nKey Features:\nHistory Eraser\nClean cache Files\nClean unused files\nManage and clean app packages\nRemind unused files when app installed\nKill running tasks/release RAM\n\nKW: cache, clean, android, phone, unused, gameloft, apk, privacy, history, cleaner, booster, 1tap boost, task killer, eraser"
    recentChanges: "1. New APP Manager with Uninstaller replacing Temp Apk.\n2. Backup comes within Uninstaller.\n3. Add Large files detection (video and compressed file) in Residual files module.\n4. Add \"Rate us\" in menu, it would be highly appreciated if rating us in Google Play.\n5. Portuguese language supported.\n6. Other optimizations and bug fixes."

content://calendar is for Android 2.2.  In android 2.2+, it's com.android.calendar.

m_locationManager = 
(LocationManager)getSystemService(Context.LOCATION_SERVICE); 
Location location = m_locationManager.getCurrentLocation("gps");
android.permission.ACCESS_LOCATION
android.permission.ACCESS_GPS

In Android <2.2, it's android.os.IMountService.
In Android 2.2+, it's android.os.storage.IMountService.
I added android.os.IMountService as an alias.
